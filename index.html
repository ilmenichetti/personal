    <p> <strong>Hi Ali!</strong> </p><br>
    <p> We can use GitHub pages, check this here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">link text</a>.
    But remember the repo should be initialized with a readme, it is possible to add a readme now in case you didn't (you'll find the button at the end of the first page in GitHub web if it hasn't it already). Then AFAIK we can just add an index.html file and we are ready to go, we just need to edit the index to point at our documentation, I'll be happy to do that.
