abstract = {Soil moisture strongly affects the dynamics of soil organic matter and is an important environmental variable in all models predicting changes in soil carbon stocks from site to global scales. Despite this, the mechanisms determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to soil moisture remain poorly quantified, being represented in most current carbon cycle models as simple empirical functions. With the aim of providing an overview and new insights into the mechanisms involved, here we review the observations and theory behind the respiration-moisture relationship. We start by calculating best estimates of average empirical relationships using published data and comparing the results for contrasting soil types. The theoretical linkages between substrate and gas diffusivity in soil pores and heterotrophic respiration are then explored as a function of temperature and textural properties. Based on this theoretical model we interpret the variability of moisture effects observed in previous empirical studies. Transient CO2 efflux-moisture relationships are discussed next, reviewing the theory and models developed in the last years with particular emphasis on the 'Birch effect'. We continue by giving an overview of recent pore-scale models and consider how these can be used to gain a more mechanistic understanding of carbon storage and stabilization in variably saturated soils. From this review we conclude that current empirical models are useful but limited approximations, with questionable predictive capacity. Significant efforts are still necessary to represent the full range of soil moisture responses in a unifying model with a sound theoretical basis that can help identify common underlying processes. Equations present here, combining diffusion, texture and substrate to model respiration, are a step forward in this direction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have analyzed the carbon sequestration potential of forests and forest management. However, most studies either focused on national and supra-national scales or on the project level in the context of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. Few studies are available which analyze the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies on carbon sequestration, timber production and other forest services and functions at the operational level of the forest management unit (FMU). The present study investigates effects of three alternative management strategies for secondary Norway spruce forests (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (Norway spruce age class forestry; continuous cover forestry; conversion to mixed broadleaved forests) and an unmanaged control variant on C sequestration in situ, in wood products and through bioenergy production at the level of a private FMU in Austria, and analyses the interrelationships with timber production and key indicators of biodiversity. The hybrid patch model PICUS v1.4 and a wood products model are employed to simulate forest ecosystem development, timber production, carbon storage in the forest and in wood product pools. Results show that in situ C sequestration is sensitive to forest management with the highest amount of carbon stored in the unmanaged strategy, followed by the continuous cover regime. All three management strategies store substantial quantities of C in the wood products pool. Considering alternative biomass utilization focused on bioenergy production, substantial C offsets could be generated from potential substitution of fossil fuels. Opportunity cost estimates for C sequestration reveal that C sequestration through forest management can be a cost efficient way to reduce atmospheric CO2, but the achievable quantities are limited due to biological limitations and societal constraints. The study emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable forest management strategies that serve the multiple demands on forests in the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the root : shoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. Previous reviews have examined root : shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable root : shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. This study reviewed root : shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. A key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. Of the 786 root : shoot ratio observations collated, 62% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. When only the reliable data were examined, root : shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height. Although a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. When the root : shoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. The use of the vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {The herbicide glyphosate is an important tool for weed management in many agricultural systems, but concerns have been raised that its increasing use impacts soil biology. At present, the influence of glyphosate on soil microbial biomass (SMB) and soil microbial respiration (SMR) is unclear, with inconsistent results across published studies. We hypothesised that differences in rates and formulation of herbicide application, presence or absence of plants, and variability in soil parameters such as pH and organic carbon (OC), may have contributed to the inconsistent results. To identify trends in the literature, we conducted a meta-analysis using linear mixed-effect and boosted regression tree models. Moderator variables included glyphosate concentration, soil pH, OC, planted or un-planted soils, field or pot experiments and time after glyphosate application. Glyphosate application, as well as moderator variables (pH, glyphosate concentration, OC and time after application) significantly affected microbial biomass and its activity. Increases in glyphosate and OC concentrations led to transitory enhancement (less than 60 days) of SMR and SMB, while respiration tended to be reduced after 60 days. Notably, field application rates (i.e. <10 mg kg-1) had no significant effect on SMR or SMB, but SMB was significantly lower at glyphosate concentrations of 10-100 mg kg-1. Ultimately, the fact that management and environmental factors regulated the soil microbial response means that generalisations about the toxicity or safety of glyphosate to SMR and SMB should be qualified with details of the conditions under which glyphosate is applied.},

@article{Wiebe2012,
abstract = {Abstract Coarse woody debris (CWD) in the boreal ecosystem has been hypothesized to play an important nutritional role following stand-replacing disturbances such as fire or harvest. Sites with shallow soil over bedrock, or those with coarse-textured soils, can be especially susceptible to overstory removal because low carbon and nutrient pools may limit stand productivity in subsequent rotations. On these site types, CWD can provide essential nutrition to the developing second growth stand, prior to internal cycling processes stabilizing at crown closure (15 years to 20 years after stand initiation) through slow and steady decomposition. The current study sites were established in 1994 and in 2008 (14 years following harvesting) and were approaching crown closure. The experimental harvest areas were designed to document carbon loss and nutrient fluxes after the application of four levels of biomass removal from mature black spruce forested stands in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Two soil types (fresh, loamy : dry, sandy), with stand replicates (blocks), were selected to test whether residual CWD represents a source or sink for nutrients, and if the decay pattern varied depending on soil type. Measurement/sampling of CWD was done immediately after the harvest treatments were applied, and again in year 4 and year 14. The biomass removal treatment with the greatest carbon loss and fastest CWD decay rate had the highest initial mass of CWD, indicating possible synergistic decay dynamics. Nitrogen concentration in the CWD continued to increase from the initial measurements to year 14 (from 900 ppm to 2400 ppm), but was largely a function of increasing carbon loss. When converted to N content in CWD (kg ha-1), however, nitrogen exhibited an initial upward trend (i.e., immobilization) through years 1to 4 (from 50 kg ha-1 up to 80 kg ha-1) and a subsequent release in years 5 to 14 (from 80 kg ha-1down to 27 kg ha-1). This trend was more apparent on the dry, sandy sites where N content peaked at almost 100 kg ha-1 at year 4, but then reduced to 26 kg ha-1 by year 14. We compared the average loss of N from CWD in years 4 to 14 (5.3 kg ha-1 yr-1) to the total soil inorganic N pool (based on a fresh K2SO4 extraction), and found that the N loss from CWD represented a substantive portion (80%) of the available N pool, particularly on the dry, sandy sites. After an initial peak in year 4, black spruce foliar N decreased significantly (p<.0001) through to year 10 but began to rebound by year 15. This increase, presumably, was in part the result of the documented release of N from CWD. These results suggest that CWD, although a small contributor to the total N pool, makes a substantial contribution to the relatively small available N pool, especially on dry, sandy soils. The trend of initial N immobilization and subsequent release shows CWD may also serve to buffer the initial leaching of nutrients from the site following harvesting and provide an available source of N to the regenerating stand prior to crown closure.},

abstract = {Soil organic C (SOC) in agricultural soils is affected by cropping system. In order to compare the impact of ley-dominated and cereal monoculture rotations on soil properties, a series of experiments was started in Sweden in the early 1980s. This study quantified the effect of rotations and N fertilisation on SOC stocks and microbial community composition. After 35 years, soil samples taken down to 50-cm depth at two sites with contrasting soil texture (clay and loam) were analysed for soil C and N, bulk density and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content. Significant increases in SOC concentrations and stocks were found in the ley-dominated rotation compared with the cereal monoculture rotation, the difference being 0.36 and 0.59 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in the topsoil (0–20 cm) for sites with the clay and loam texture, respectively, in average over N fertiliser levels. Nitrogen fertilisation increased SOC stocks significantly in the cereal monoculture, but not in the ley-dominated rotation. In the loam, SOC responses in the subsoil were almost as high as those in the topsoil, but they were insignificant in the clay soil. These results indicate that soil texture and structure can have a great impact on the potential of subsoils to sequester C, which requires attention when scaling up SOC sequestration rates for regional or global assessments.},

abstract = {Abstract The relative importance of N fixation, organic material inputs and nutrient inputs in litterfall, as justifications for including shade trees in plantations of coffee or cacao, is discussed. According to existing data, N fixation by leguminous shade trees does not exceed 60 kg.N/ha/a. However, these trees contribute 5,000{\^{a}}€“10,000 kg. organic material/ha/a.Comparisons are made between the leguminous shade tree Erythrina poeppigiana and the non-leguminous timber tree Cordia alliodora. The former, when pruned 2 or 3 times/a., can return to the litter layer the same amount of nutrients that are applied to coffee plantations via inorganic fertilizers, even at the highest recommended rates for Costa Rica of 270 kg.N, 60 kg.P, 150 kg.K/ha/a. The annual nutrient return in this litterfall represents 90{\^{a}}€“100 percent of the nutrient store in above-ground biomass of E. poeppigiana, and hence the consequences of competition with the crop should not be a serious limitation. In the case of C. alliodora, which is not pruned, nutrient storage in the tree stems, especially of K, is a potential limiting factor to both crop and tree productivity.It is concluded that, in fertilized plantations of cacao and coffee, litter productivity is a more important shade tree characteristic than N fixation.},

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes are the proximate agents of organic matter decomposition and measures of these activities can be used as indicators of microbial nutrient demand. We conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of the seven-most widely measured soil enzyme activities, using data from 40 ecosystems. The activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and phosphatase g(-1) soil increased with organic matter concentration; leucine aminopeptidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities showed no relationship. All activities were significantly related to soil pH. Specific activities, i.e. activity g(-1) soil organic matter, also varied in relation to soil pH for all enzymes. Relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) were generally weak. For hydrolases, ratios of specific C, N and P acquisition activities converged on 1 : 1 : 1 but across ecosystems, the ratio of C : P acquisition was inversely related to MAP and MAT while the ratio of C : N acquisition increased with MAP. Oxidative activities were more variable than hydrolytic activities and increased with soil pH. Our analyses indicate that the enzymatic potential for hydrolyzing the labile components of soil organic matter is tied to substrate availability, soil pH and the stoichiometry of microbial nutrient demand. The enzymatic potential for oxidizing the recalcitrant fractions of soil organic material, which is a proximate control on soil organic matter accumulation, is most strongly related to soil pH. These trends provide insight into the biogeochemical processes that create global patterns in ecological stoichiometry and organic matter storage.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopes are used extensively to examine physiological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes related to ecosystem, regional, and global carbon cycles and provide information at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Much is known about the processes that regulate the carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)C) of leaf, plant, and ecosystem carbon pools and of photosynthetic and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fluxes. In this review, systematic patterns and mechanisms underlying variation in delta(13)C of plant and ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes are described. We examine the hypothesis that the delta(13)C of leaf biomass can be used as a reference point for other carbon pools and fluxes, which differ from the leaf in delta(13)C in a systematic fashion. Plant organs are typically enriched in (13)C relative to leaves, and most ecosystem pools and respiratory fluxes are enriched relative to sun leaves of dominant plants, with the notable exception of root respiration. Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of leaves and leaf respiration suggests that growth respiration has the potential to contribute substantially to the observed offset between the delta(13)C values of ecosystem respiration and the bulk leaf. We discuss the implications of systematic variations in delta(13)C of ecosystem pools and CO(2) fluxes for studies of carbon cycling within ecosystems, as well as for studies that use the delta(13)C of atmospheric CO(2) to diagnose changes in the terrestrial biosphere over annual to millennial time scales.},

abstract = {The widely used ecosystem model DailyDayCent (DDC) was used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and yield under different fertilization treatments on a wheat (Triticum aestivum) monoculture on Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, UK. Over a period of about 170 years, the management practices on the test site, which is separated into plots with different treatments of fertilizer and manure application, are well documented. Four treatments consisting of control (no fertilizer), mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer (MN), farm yard manure (FYM) and a combination of both (FYMN) have been selected for the study. DDC simulated the greatest increases in SOC (three times higher compared to simulation of the control plot) in the FYM plot. Overall a good agreement between modelled and measured yield was obtained (except in control plots). As observed in the experimental plots, the highest yield predicted by the model is with FYMN plot (more than three times higher relative to the control plot). A sensitivity test for the MN and FYM plots demonstrated that predicted SOC was relatively insensitive (1%) to bulk density, pH and field capacity. Higher sensitivity (4–7%) of predicted SOC changes were observed by changes in external C input. An increase of temperature by 1 °C or precipitation by 10% decreased predicted SOC by 2–4% and vice versa, and simulated a 1–4% variability in yield. DDC is a useful tool for simulating SOC in the long term plots, with a good fit to data, and is useful for examining alternate hypotheses of yield and SOC responses.},

abstract = {Most current soil organic matter (SOM) models represent the soil as a bulk without specification of the vertical distribution of SOM in the soil profile. However, the vertical SOM profile may be of great importance for soil carbon cycling, both on short (hours to years) time scale, due to interactions with the soil temperature and moisture profile, as well as on long (years to centuries) time scale because of depth-specific stabilization mechanisms of organic matter. It is likely that a representation of the SOM profile and surface organic layers in SOM models can improve predictions of the response of land surface fluxes to climate and environmental variability. Although models capable of simulating the vertical SOM profile exist, these were generally not developed for large scale predictive simulations and do not adequately represent surface organic horizons. We present SOMPROF, a vertically explicit SOM model, designed for implementation into large scale ecosystem and land surface models. The model dynamically simulates the vertical SOM profile and organic layer stocks based on mechanistic representations of bioturbation, liquid phase transport of organic matter, and vertical distribution of root litter input. We tested the model based on data from an old growth deciduous forest (Hainich) in Germany, and performed a sensitivity analysis of the transport parameters, and the effects of the vertical SOM distribution on temporal variation of heterotrophic respiration. Model results compare well with measured organic carbon profiles and stocks. SOMPROF is able to simulate a wide range of SOM profiles, using parameter values that are realistic compared to those found in previous studies. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that the vertical SOM distribution strongly affects temporal variation of heterotrophic respiration due to interactions with the soil temperature and moisture profile. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Evidence-based medicine is a concept that has come to the fore in the past few years. Clinicians are increasingly encouraged to practise patient management based on available evidence in the scientific literature. For example, new pharmacological therapies are only used when large randomized trials have 'proven' that a particular drug is better than existing ones. This is also the case in surgical specialties, although surgery has traditionally seen a lack of use of this information, with individual surgeon's preferences being most influential in treatment choices. However, more recently, there has been a large expansion of trials and studies aimed at providing surgeons with information to guide their choices using firm evidence. This new edition has been revised and expanded to include new data where relevant, and also features a new chapter on pituitary surgery. Landmark Papers in Neurosurgery 2e remains a key collection of the most important trials and studies in neurosurgery, allowing the reader to rapidly extract key results, and making it essential reading for all neurosurgeons and trainees in the field.},

abstract = {Microbial detritus contributes substantially to the soil organic matter (SOM). Analysis of global literature indicated that microbial detritus carbon (C) contributed 59 and 64% of total soil C in arable agricultural and grassland systems respectively, with a 2.5% greater contribution of bacterial-derived detritus in grasslands and with no difference in the proportional contribution of fungal detritus. Total soil C and nitrogen (N) content was higher in grasslands with an average of 2.8 and 1.6 g N kg−1 soil and 28.8 and 16.8 g C kg−1 soil in grassland and arable systems, respectively. Soil N content explained 11 to 28% of the variance in microbial detritus contribution to soil C. Further, total soil N and C content explained more variance than other factors which are commonly considered to mediate SOM content including precipitation, acidity and clay. Microbial biomass C assimilation and re-metabolism of SOM are affected by nutrient supply and the dissimilarity of the C to N, phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) ratios between fresh organic matter (FOM), SOM and microorganisms (C:N:P:S 10,000:261:32:48, 10,000:833:200:143, and 10,000:1,494:458:154, respectively). In agricultural systems, stoichiometrically balanced nutrient addition to FOM can increase C transfer to SOM by 6 to 52% and importantly reduce the mineralization of pre-existing SOM by 24 to 50%. Future research to quantify economic and environmental implications is warranted with need for a paradigm shift in thinking to focus on the nutrient requirements of the whole soil–plant system rather than the agronomic requirements of crops alone.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of the temperature response of biological processes in soil is based on the Arrhenius equation. This predicts an exponential increase in rate as temperature rises, whereas in the laboratory and in the field, there is always a clearly identifiable temperature optimum for all microbial processes. In the laboratory, this has been explained by denaturation of enzymes at higher temperatures, and in the field, the availability of substrates and water is often cited as critical factors. Recently, we have shown that temperature optima for enzymes and microbial growth occur in the absence of denaturation and that this is a consequence of the unusual heat capacity changes associated with enzymes. We have called this macromolecular rate theory - MMRT (Hobbs et al., , ACS Chem. Biol. 8:2388). Here, we apply MMRT to a wide range of literature data on the response of soil microbial processes to temperature with a focus on respiration but also including different soil enzyme activities, nitrogen and methane cycling. Our theory agrees closely with a wide range of experimental data and predicts temperature optima for these microbial processes. MMRT also predicted high relative temperature sensitivity (as assessed by Q10 calculations) at low temperatures and that Q10 declined as temperature increases in agreement with data synthesis from the literature. Declining Q10 and temperature optima in soils are coherently explained by MMRT which is based on thermodynamics and heat capacity changes for enzyme-catalysed rates. MMRT also provides a new perspective, and makes new predictions, regarding the absolute temperature sensitivity of ecosystems - a fundamental component of models for climate change.},

abstract = {The importance of dead wood (coarse woody debris, CWD) for biodiversity in boreal forests is high that is mainly due to its role in nutrient cycling and species habitation. Recognition of its importance in storing carbon has also raised an interest in developing new methods for assessing the quantity and quality of CWD. Since the traditional measuring techniques are often expensive to apply for the estimation of volume characteristics in the field, more attention is currently being paid to remote-sensing techniques that could provide lower cost data for forest inventories over large areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data for estimating downed and standing dead wood volumes. The analysis was based on field measurements from 33 sample plots which were evaluated against the ALS-derived height-intensity metrics obtained from the Koli National Park in eastern Finland. The accuracy of the ALS data proved adequate for predicting the downed dead wood volume (RMSE 51.6%), whereas the standing dead wood volume estimates were somewhat poorer (RMSE 78.8%). The ALS-based volume estimates for downed dead wood were found to be substantially more accurate than the estimates based on field-measured characteristics of living trees. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We compiled an up-to-date global database covering 186 stands from the literature and estimated fine root production (FRP) and fine root turnover (FRT) for boreal, temperate and tropical forests in order to study the relationships between FRP or FRT and environmental and stand variables. FRP for all plants (trees+understorey) was 311±259 (n=39), 428±375 (n=71) and 596±478gm-2a-1(n=32) in the boreal, temperate and tropical forests, respectively, and the corresponding annual FRT rates were 0.77±0.70, 1.21±1.04 and 1.44±0.76, respectively. When the FRP and FRT of trees were estimated separately for boreal and temperate forests the differences between the two biomes were insignificant. The mean FRP of trees for the two biomes combined was 306±240gm-2a-1(n=86) and the annual FRT was 1.31±1.43. Fine root biomass (FRB) was the most significant factor explaining the variation in FRP, and more so at the tree level than at the stand level, explaining 53% of the variation in FRP for trees at the tree level. The corresponding proportions at the stand level were 21% for all plants and 12% for trees. Latitude, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation each explained <20% of the variation in FRP or FRT. Fine root production and FRT estimates are highly dependent on the species included in the sampling, the sampling depth and the methods used for estimating FRP or calculating FRT. The results indicate that the variation in FRP on a global scale can be explained to a higher degree if we focus on tree roots separately from the roots of the understorey vegetation and on FRP at the tree level instead of FRP at the stand level or on FRT. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Modelling of ecosystem processes often requires soil temperature as a driving variable. Since soil temperature measurements are seldom available for regional applications, they have to be estimated from standard meteorological data. The objective of this paper is to present a general, simple empirical approach for estimating daily depth profiles of soil temperature from air temperature and a surface cover index (LAI; leaf area index) mainly focusing on agricultural soils in cold temperate regions. Air and soil temperature data measured daily or every fifth day at one to six different depths were acquired from all meteorological stations in Sweden where such records are available. The stations cover latitudes from 55.65 degrees to 68.42 degrees N and mean annual air temperatures from +8.6 to -0.6 degrees C. The time series spanned between two and ten years. The soils at the stations cover a wide range of soil textures, including two organic soils. We calibrated the model first for each station and then for all stations together and the general parameterization only slightly decreased the goodness of fit. This general model then was applied to two treatments in a field experiment: bare soil and a winter rape crop. The parameters governing the influence of LAI on heat fluxes were optimized using this experiment. Finally, the model was validated using soil temperature data from two barley treatments differing in LAI taken from another field experiment. In general, the model predicted daily soil temperature profiles well. For all soils and depths at the meteorological stations, 95% of the simulated daily soil temperatures differed by less than 2.8 degrees C from measurements. The corresponding differences were somewhat higher for the validation data set (3.9 degrees C), but bias was still low. The model explained 95% of the variation in the validation data. Since no site-specific adjustments were made in the validation simulations, we conclude that the application of the general model presented here will result in good estimates of soil temperatures under cold temperate conditions. The very limited input requirements (only air temperature and LAI) that are easily obtainable from weather stations and from satellites make this model suitable for spatial applications at catchment or regional scales.},

Net primary productivity and below-ground crop residue inputs for root crops: Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 87–93. Root crops are significant in agro-ecosystems of temperate climates. However, the amounts of crop residues for these crop types are not well documented and they need to be accounted for in the modeling of soil organic carbon dynamics. Our objective was to review field measurements of root biomass left in the soil as crop residues at harvest for potato and sugar beet. We considered estimates for crop residue inputs as root biomass presented in the literature and some unpublished results. Our analysis showed that compared to, for example, cereals, the contribution of below-ground net primary productivity (NPP) to crop residues is at least two to three times lower for root crops. Indeed, the field measurements indicated that root biomass for topsoils only rep...},

abstract = {Accurately quantifying soil base cation pool sizes is essential to interpreting the sustainability of forest harvests from element mass-balance studies. The soil-exchangeable pool is classically viewed as the bank of "available" base cations in the soil, withdrawn upon by plant uptake and leaching and refilled by litter decomposition, atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering. The operational definition of this soil bank as the exchangeable (salt-extractable) pools ignores the potential role of "other" soil nutrient pools, including microbial biomass, clay interlayer absorbed elements, and calcium oxalate. These pools can be large relative to "exchangeable" pools. Thus neglecting these other pools in studies examining the sustainability of biomass extractions, or need for nutrient return, limits our ability to gauge the threat or risk of unsustainable biomass removals. We examine a set of chemical extraction data from a mature Norway spruce forest in central Sweden and compare this dataset to ecosystem flux data gathered from the site in previous research. The 0.2&thinsp;M HCl extraction released large pools of Ca, K, Mg, and Na, considerably larger than the exchangeable pools. Where net losses of base cations are predicted from biomass harvest, exchangeable pools may not be sufficient to support more than a single 65-year forest rotation, but acid-extractable pools are sufficient to support many rotations of net-ecosystem losses. We examine elemental ratios, soil clay and carbon contents, and pool depth trends to identify the likely origin of the HCl-extractable pool. No single candidate compound class emerges, as very strongly supported by the data, as being the major constituent of the HCl-extractable fraction. A combination of microbial biomass, fine grain, potentially shielded, easily weatherable minerals, and non-structural clay interlayer bound potassium may explain the size and distribution of the acid-extractable base cation pool. Sequential extraction techniques and isotope-exchange measurements should be further developed and, if possible, complemented with spectroscopic techniques to illuminate the identity of and flux rates through these important, and commonly overlooked, nutrient pools.},

abstract = {Concern about excessive woody debris removals during biomass harvests has led to the development of biomass harvesting guidelines (BHGs) for retaining woody debris for habitat and nutrient cycling. However, the efficacy of BHGs has not been experimentally examined. Two BHG treatments applied during clearcutting and thinning operations were examined in a replicated complete-block experiment. The first BHG treatment included the retention of one-third of tops of trees ≥8 in. dbh and one-third of trees <8-in. dbh. The second included the retention of all tops of trees ≥8-in. dbh and no restriction on the removal of smaller trees. In clearcuts, the two BHGs each increased the biomass of woody debris retained by 1.7 times compared to where no BHG was applied. However, in thinned units, there were no differences in retained woody debris regardless of BHG application. Nutrient retention trends followed those of biomass. Nutrients retained in woody debris generally exceeded nutrient removals in harvested wood except for calcium, for which removals equaled retention where BHGs were applied and exceeded retention in the absence of BHGs. Findings suggest that applying BHGs for retaining woody debris becomes more important as harvest intensity increases.},

abstract = {Volume increment and ingrowth are important aspects of stand development and regeneration dynamics for determining the effectiveness of uneven-aged silvicultural systems. The main objectives of this thesis were to establish the influence of standing volume on volume increment after different kinds of harvest regimes, the influence of overstorey density on height growth of advance regeneration, and the influence of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) on spruce regeneration in managed uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests in boreal Sweden.Model simulations with 5-year growth iterations and three harvest regimes of diameter-limit, single-tree selection, and schematic harvests were used to investigate the influence of standing volume on volume increment. Additionally, field experiments at two sites, re-inventoried ten years after treatments that had a 3×2 factorial design of three thinning intensities (30, 60, 85% of pre-harvest standing volume) and two types of thinning (harvested larger or smaller trees), were used. The influence of overstorey density on height growth was established using one of the sites that measured height increments of seedlings, saplings, and small trees in the plots. A field investigation was carried out to establish the influence of bilberry on spruce saplings, which cut bilberry stems in 1 m2 circle plots around treated saplings and their height growth compared to the control saplings with uncut bilberry stems.Volume increment increased with increasing standing volume, culminated, and eventually declined. The highest volume increment was found for diameter-limit harvests followed by single-tree selection and schematic harvests. For harvesting a residual stand to 50 m3ha-1, the schematic harvest showed increment losses equalling 25 years of growth. For the field experiments at both sites, standing volume was correlated significantly positively (p<0.05) with volume increment. Only for the more productive site, standing volume was correlated significantly negatively (p<0.05) with ingrowth. The height increments for all spruce advance regeneration were better correlated with canopy openness than with basal area or standing volume. Treated saplings decreased in height increment compared to the control during the first and second year after cutting bilberry.In conclusion, volume increment increased with increasing standing volume and harvesting mostly the larger trees in a residual stand with large number of stems and large number of small trees yields high volume increments. At both sites the ingrowth of spruce regeneration was low, but higher than mortality and the number of trees removed, and thus it was sufficient to replace the harvested trees. The cutting of bilberry reduced the height growth of spruce regeneration.},

Since growth depends on the availability of various essentials to the growing tissues, correlation seems to be a question of competition. It is true that the co-ordina-tion is controlled in a very complex way. Both hormonal control and nutritive features play a role, the latter being the most important in agricultural practice. Although no satisfying picture has hitherto been obtained, it is clear that it is possible to fore-cast the effect of many external conditions. Increasing mineral supply tends to increase shoot growth relative to root growth; increasing water supply has the same effect; increasing light intensity promotes root growth at the expense of shoot growth. The manner in which these distribution patterns are effected is described in the present paper.},

abstract = {Red deer Cervus elaphus, even in wilderness areas, are increasingly exposed to disturbance from human recreation as well as hunting, and it has been suggested that both types of disturbance may be perceived as a predation risk. We studied the vigilance behaviour of red deer in the Scottish Highlands, in sites with traditionally high numbers of visitors ('disturbed') and sites with relatively few visitors ('less-disturbed') during the main recreational season (spring and summer), and in their mating grounds during the hunting season (autumn and winter). We carried out direct observations, using scan sampling at 3-minute intervals for 1-hour periods, and recorded the number of animals in each group that were vigilant and their mode of vigilance. During the recreational season, in both the disturbed and less-disturbed sites, data were collected in habitats with different levels of cover (grassland, heather and woodland). The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher in disturbed than in less-disturbed sites, and higher in disturbed grassland (poor cover) and heather (intermediate cover) than in disturbed woodland (good cover). The majority of the vigilant animals in disturbed heather and woodland habitats and in all the less-disturbed habitats were standing. In disturbed grassland, however, lying was the main posture whilst vigilant. In both disturbed grassland and heather, the percentage of vigilant animals that were moving was higher than in woodland or the less-disturbed habitats. In disturbed sites, the deer were more likely to be aggregated when vigilance levels were high. During the hunting season, the overall level of vigilance was higher than at any sites during the recreational season, and the majority of vigilant animals were moving. We conclude that red deer respond to disturbance from human recreational activities by increasing their level of vigilance, but that the nature of their response varies with the level of cover available. We suggest that red deer may lie down when keeping vigil in grasslands, because lying animals are less conspicuous and the low cover will still allow animals to scan their surroundings. We conclude that, although they respond to both types of disturbance by increasing vigilance, red deer perceive human recreation as a less acute threat than hunting.},

Empirical data from long-term field experiments in Sweden, two sites with Norway spruce and two with Scots pine with different levels of productivity, were used to calibrate the model against the stem-only treatment. The highest initial reduction in soil C, N and Ca stores was predicted for SSlSt, and the reduction was more pronounced at low productive sites than at the high productive ones. Most of the decline in soil C and Ca stocks was offset by the litter production in the following forest stand. N showed an initial phase of immobilisation in stumps and coarse roots, while N was immediately released from tops and branches, which contained N-rich needles. Removal of stumps and coarse roots in combination with slash resulted in a similar load of inorganic soil N as for the S treatment, whereas the SSl treatment with stumps left in the soil initially reduced the inorganic soil N pool. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. Northern peatlands have been accumulating organic matter since the start of the Holocene, and are now a substantial store of terrestrial carbon. However, their current status as carbon sinks is less clear, because of the possible effects of climate change, air pollution, grazing and drainage etc., and the difficulties of accurate measurement with suitable time resolution. Such measurements are particularly lacking in the UK. Here, we present multi-year eddy covariance measurements of the carbon fluxes at a relatively undisturbed ombrotrophic blanket bog in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The site consistently acted as a moderate sink for CO2over all the measurement years (mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -114 g C m-2y-1), similar in magnitude to other measurements in the boreal and tundra zones, and rather higher than the existing measurements at other sites in the UK and Ireland. Generally, the NEE of CO2was relatively insensitive to moderate inter-annual variations in weather. Non-CO2losses comprised 11% of gross primary production, mainly from methane emissions. Accounting for these terms, the net ecosystem carbon balance was -50 g C-CO2eq m-2y-1. The contemporary carbon sink was larger than estimates from local peat cores, based on peat accumulation over the last several thousand years, but in the middle of the range of estimates which used spheroidal carbonaceous particles to estimate peat accumulation rates over the last century.},

abstract = {Greater exploitation of subsoil resources by annual crops would afford multiple benefits, including greater water and N acquisition in most agroecosystems, and greater sequestration of atmospheric C. Constraints to root growth in the subsoil include soil acidity (an edaphic stress complex consisting of toxic levels of Al, inadequate levels of P and Ca, and often toxic levels of Mn), soil compaction, hypoxia, and suboptimal temperature. Multiple root phenes under genetic control are associated with adaptation to these constraints, opening up the possibility of breeding annual crops with root traits improving subsoil exploration. Adaptation to Al toxicity, hypoxia, and P deficiency are intensively researched, adaptation to soil hardness and suboptimal temperature less so, and adaptations to Ca deficiency and Mn toxicity are poorly understood. The utility of specific phene states may vary among soil taxa and management scenarios, interactions which in general are poorly understood. These traits and issues merit research because of their potential value in developing more productive, sustainable, benign, and resilient agricultural systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Stumps from the last felling constitute a large proportion of dead wood in young managed forests. Yet, the knowledge of the diversity of stump-inhabiting organisms is poor. We studied the importance of substrate age and quality to lichen and bryophyte diversity on the cut surface of stumps in south-central Sweden. In total, we found 53 lichens and 35 bryophytes on 449 Norway spruce stumps in a forest stand chronosequence of four age classes: 4-5, 8-9, 12-13 and 16-18 years old stands. The influence of substrate age and substrate quality on species diversity differed between lichens and bryophytes. Lichen species richness was higher for age classes 2-4 compared to age class 1, whereas bryophyte richness was higher in age classes 3-4 than in 1. Further, lichen richness increased with increasing stump height and the presence of surface structural components (chairs and levels), which together with decay also influenced lichen species composition. Conversely, increasing stump height and the presence of levels decreased bryophyte richness, which in turn increased with increasing decay, surface area and number of surrounding trees and shrubs. Only decay explained differences in bryophyte species composition. Stumps in this region seem more important to overall lichen diversity, because there were on average more lichen species per stump and we only found common bryophytes but several uncommon lichens. The different responses of lichens and bryophytes to age and substrate variables indicates, however, the importance of including several organism groups in species diversity studies of dead wood.},

abstract = {We used a gap-type forest ecosystem model to study how even- A nd uneven-aged management affected the carbon dynamics and timber production in boreal Norway spruce stands. In business-as-usual management, the intensity of thinnings (from below) and single-tree selective cuttings followed those recommended for even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged management (BSC) in practical forestry in Finland. Moreover, higher or lower basal area thresholds, and shorter or longer production cycles, were used in simulations. We found that, the mean annual carbon uptake, volume growth, and carbon stock in trees and harvested timber, were nearly the same under even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged (BSC) management, when assuming full seed crop in latter one. However, the carbon stock in the soil and ecosystem and the mean annual net ecosystem exchange were slightly smaller under BT. The carbon retention time was longer under BSC. The net present value (NPV with interest rate of 3 per cent) of timber production was clearly lower under BT, when the calculation was initiated at planting on clear-cutting area, in opposite to when initiating calculation a few years before the second thinning. Higher basal area thresholds and longer production cycles increased carbon stocks, carbon retention and timber yield, regardless of management system. On the other hand, the results of uneven-aged management (BSC) were very sensitive to the success of natural regeneration and ingrowth of seedlings, as a reduction of the seed crop by 25-75 per cent from the full seed crop decreases the volume growth by 44-74 per cent and timber yield up to 46 per cent.},

However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees' general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees' relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence. Finally, we offer an agenda for micro-level research on corporate social responsibility. Contents},

abstract = {Purpose: Despite its wide application in determining litter decomposition rates, the litterbag method has not well been examined involving some criteria, especially the sample weight and placement of litterbags. Materials and methods: A comprehensive database of leaf litter decomposition in China was established, including 877 datasets, to examine the controlling factors of litterbag method at the large scale. Results and discussion: Researchers preferentially chose 1 mm, 1 year, 10 g per litterbag, and laying the litterbags on the soil surface as mesh size, incubation duration, litter sample weight, and placement, respectively. The decomposition rate positively correlated with the mesh size and negatively correlated with the incubation duration. Increasing sample weight reduced the decomposition rate, which is not reported by previous studies, probably due to the decreases of exposure of litters. The decomposition rates were overestimated by burying the litterbags in the soil. Conclusions: Leaf litter decomposition rate was influenced by the criteria of litterbag method. To ensure the data comparability and further carbon modeling, the sample weight and placement of litterbags should be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {Aim: Agroforestry is a globally practised system of land use for achieving greater and more diverse biomass production, but it has other ecological benefits, such as mitigation of climate change. Despite this, long-term carbon (C) accumulation in different components of agroforestry systems, the drivers for C accumulation and the linkages between tree biomass and soil C stocks remain unclear. Location: Global. Time period: From 1989 to 2019. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Here, we report on a global meta-analysis based on 141 studies to identify patterns of C accumulation in tree-based agroforestry systems compared with sole cropland and pasture. Results: We found that agroforestry systems had, on average, 46.1 Mg/ha (95% confidence interval, 36.4–55.8 Mg/ha) more C in tree biomass compared with sole cropland- or pasture-based land uses without trees. Furthermore, agroforestry systems with multiple tree species contained greater biomass C stocks and accumulated biomass C faster than systems with a single tree species. The effect of agroforestry practices on soil C stock increased with tree age, although such increases varied among climatic zones. Agroforestry systems in tropical zones had the ability to increase soil C to peak levels quickly, whereas soil C in temperate zones increased at a slower rate but peaked at a greater overall soil C level. Our structural equation model did not detect a direct linkage between biomass C and changes in total soil C stock in agroforestry systems. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that planting multiple tree species in agroforestry systems is an important strategy to increase biomass C sequestration, with regional climate affecting the temporal change of soil C in response to agroforestry practices.},

abstract = {The chemical complexity of decomposing plant litter is a central feature shaping the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, but explanations of the origin of this complexity remain contentious. Here, we ask: How does litter chemistry change during decomposition, and what roles do decomposers play in these changes? During a long-term (730 days) litter decomposition experiment, we tracked concurrent changes in decomposer community structure and function and litter chemistry using high-resolution molecular techniques. Contrary to the current paradigm, we found that the chemistry of different litter types diverged, rather than converged, during decomposition due to the activities of decomposers. Furthermore, the same litter type exposed to different decomposer communities exhibited striking differences in chemistry, even after > 90% mass loss. Our results show that during decomposition, decomposer community characteristics regulate changes in litter chemistry, which could influence the functionality of litter-derived soil organic matter (SOM) and the turnover and stabilisation of soil C.},

abstract = {1. Changes in the balance between soil carbon storage and release can significantly amplify or attenuate global warming. Although a lot of progress has been made in determining potential drivers of carbon release through large-scale decomposition experiments, climate predictions are still hampered by data limitation at a global scale as a result of high effort and measurement costs of comparative litter decomposition studies. 2. We introduce an innovative, cost-effective, well-standardised method to gather data on decomposition rate and litter stabilisation using commercially available tea bags as standardised test kits. By using two tea types with contrasting decomposability, we can construct a decomposition curve using a single measurement in time. The acquired Tea Bag Index (TBI) consists of two parameters describing decomposition rate (k) and litter stabilisation factor (S). 3. The method was tested for its sensitivity and robustness in contrasting ecosystems and biomes, confirming that the TBI is sensitive enough to discriminate between these systems. Within an ecosystem, TBI is responsive to differences in abiotic circumstances such as soil temperature and moisture content. The collected k and S values are in accordance with expectations based on decomposition process literature. They are therefore interpretable within the current knowledge framework. 4. Tea Bag Index is a unique, multifunctional method requiring few resources and minimal prior knowledge. The standardisation and simplicity of the method make it possible to collect comparable, globally distributed data through crowdsourcing. TBI can further provide an excellent decomposition reference and has the potential to increase reliability of soil carbon flux estimates based on extrapolations of decomposition data.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon plays an important role in the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems, variations in soil organic carbon stocks are very important for the ecosystem. In this study, a geostatistical model was used for predicting current and future soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Europe. The first phase of the study predicts current soil organic carbon content by using stepwise multiple linear regression and ordinary kriging and the second phase of the study projects the soil organic carbon to the near future (2050) by using a set of environmental predictors. We demonstrate here an approach to predict present and future soil organic carbon stocks by using climate, land cover, terrain and soil data and their projections. The covariates were selected for their role in the carbon cycle and their availability for the future model. The regression-kriging as a base model is predicting current SOC stocks in Europe by using a set of covariates and dense SOC measurements coming from LUCAS Soil Database. The base model delivers coefficients for each of the covariates to the future model. The overall model produced soil organic carbon maps which reflect the present and the future predictions (2050) based on climate and land cover projections. The data of the present climate conditions (long-term average (1950-2000)) and the future projections for 2050 were obtained from WorldClim data portal. The future climate projections are the recent climate projections mentioned in the Fifth Assessment IPCC report. These projections were extracted from the global climate models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The results suggest an overall increase in SOC stocks by 2050 in Europe (EU26) under all climate and land cover scenarios, but the extent of the increase varies between the climate model and emissions scenarios.},

abstract = {Soils of high latitudes store approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is expected to increase in response to global warming, which is most pronounced in northern latitudes. It is, however, unclear if microorganisms are able to utilize more stable, recalcitrant C pools, when labile soil carbon pools will be depleted due to increasing temperatures. Here we report on an incubation experiment with intact soil cores of a frost-boil tundra ecosystem at three different temperatures (2 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 24 degrees C). In order to assess which fractions of the SOM are available for decomposition at various temperatures, we analyzed the isotopic signature of respired CO2 and of different SOM fractions. The delta13C values of CO2 respired were negatively correlated with temperature, indicating the utilization of SOM fractions that were depleted in 13C at higher temperatures. Chemical fractionation of SOM showed that the water-soluble fraction (presumably the most easily available substrates for microbial respiration) was most enriched in 13C, while the acid-insoluble pool (recalcitrant substrates) was most depleted in 13C. Our results therefore suggest that, at higher temperatures, recalcitrant compounds are preferentially respired by arctic microbes. When the isotopic signatures of respired CO2 of soils which had been incubated at 24 degrees C were measured at 12 degrees C, the delta13C values shifted to values found in soils incubated at 12 degrees C, indicating the reversible use of more easily available substrates. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acid profiles showed significant differences in microbial community structure at various incubation temperatures indicating that microorganisms with preference for more recalcitrant compounds establish as temperatures increase. In summary our results demonstrate that a large portion of tundra SOM is potentially mineralizable.},

From 18 to 26% of the total organic C in the top 2爉 was between 1 and 2爉 in all four regimes. Vertical distribution of organic C was modelled by an exponential function for which the R2 values lay in the range 0.8920130.95, depending on the regime.

abstract = {Hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is an important biomass crop being evaluated for cellulosic ethanol production. Predictions of poplar growth, rotation period, and soil carbon sequestration under various growing conditions, soils, and climates are critical for farmers and managers planning to establish short-rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. In this study, we used an ecoinformatics workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), to integrate literature data and field measurements into the Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2) model to estimate yield potential of poplar plantations. Within PEcAn 164 records of seven different traits from the literature were assimilated using a Bayesian meta-analysis. Next, variance decomposition identified seven variables for further constraint that contributed >80% to the uncertainty in modeled yields: growth respiration, dark respiration, quantum efficiency, mortality coefficient, water conductance, fine-root allocation, and root turnover rate. Assimilation of observed yields further constrained uncertainty in model parameters (especially dark respiration and root turnover rate) and biomass estimates. Additional measurements of growth respiration, mortality, water conductance, and quantum efficiency would provide the most efficient path toward further constraint of modeled yields. Modeled validation demonstrated that ED2 successfully captured the interannual and spatial variability of poplar yield observed at nine independent sites. Site-level analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of land use change to SRF poplar on soil C sequestration compared to alternate land uses. These suggest that poplar plantations became a C sink within 18 years of conversion from corn production or existing forest. Finally, poplar yields were estimated for the contiguous United States at a half degree resolution in order to determine potential productivity, estimate the optimal rotation period, and compare poplar to perennial grass yields. This regional projection suggests that poplar yield varies considerably with differences in soil and climate, reaching as much as 18 Mg{\textperiodcentered}ha -1 {\textperiodcentered}yr -1 in eastern, southern, and northwest regions. In New England, the upper Midwest, and northern California, yields are predicted to exceed those of the highly productive C 4 perennial grass, Miscanthus. In these poplar-productive regions, 4-11 year rotations give the highest potential yields. In conclusion, poplar plantations are predicted to have a high yield potential across a wide range of climates and soils and could be sustainable in soil C sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Large herbivores select food at several spatial scales: plant communities are chosen at a landscape scale, plant patches are chosen within a plant community, and individual plants within a patch. Foraging decision at the patch level can result in associational effects in plant communities and populations. Several studies have shown that herbivore attack and consumption rates may not only depend on a plant's own defence traits, but also on the defence traits of its neighbours. In the present experiment we investigated whether the spatial scale of the food distribution affects food selection by fallow deer and whether the foraging behaviour gives rise to associational effects in plant defences. In a population of captured wild fallow deer we simulated a natural situation where two separate plant patches are exposed to intense herbivory pressure. We presented different spatial arrangements of low- and high-tannin food to the deer, varying the frequency of the feeder types within and between patches. We found that the deer consumed palatable food among the unpalatable food on average as much as they consumed palatable food among other palatable feeders. However, when unpalatable food occurred among the palatable food it was more consumed than among other unpalatable feeders. Hence, we did not find support for associational defence, but our results supported associational susceptibility. At the between patch level a patch of mainly high-tannin feeders was consumed less when presented near to a patch of mainly low-tannin feeders, suggesting that for well-defended plants having palatable neighbours in a nearby patch might accentuate the effectiveness of their defence. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Microbial substrate use efficiency is an important property in process-based soil organic matter models, but is often assumed to be constant in mechanistic models. However, previous studies question if a constant efficiency is appropriate, in particular when evaluating carbon (C) cycling across temperatures and various substrates. In the present study, we evaluated the relation between substrate use efficiency, microbial community composition and substrate complexity in contrasting long-term management regimes (47–49 years of either arable, ley farming, grassland, or forest systems). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis and three indices of substrate use efficiencies were considered: (i) thermodynamic efficiency, (ii) calorespirometric ratio, and (iii) metabolic quotient. Three substrates, d-glucose, l-alanine, or glycogen, varying in complexity, were added separately to soils, and heat production as well as C mineralization was determined over a 32-h incubation period at 12.5 °C. Microbial communities from forest systems were most efficient in utilizing substrates, supporting our hypothesis that maturing ecosystems become more efficient. These changes in efficiency were linked to microbial community composition with fungi and Gram-negative bacteria being important biomarkers. Despite our initial hypothesis, complex substrate such as glycogen was utilized most efficiently. Our findings emphasize that differences in land use management systems as well as the composition of soil organic matter need to be considered when modelling C dynamics in soils. Further research is required to establish and evaluate appropriate proxies for substrate use efficiencies in various ecosystems.},

However, current ungulate management ignores the role of nonlethal risk effects of predation. * We introduce the concept of ‘hunting for fear' as an extension of the more classical ‘hunting to kill' that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. * Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves. Hunting for fear may offer novel opportunities to help manage the growing human–wildlife conflicts that we experience globally.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter models are widely used to study soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Here, we used the CENTURY model to simulate SOC in wheat-corn cropping systems at three long-term fertilization trials. Our study indicates that CENTURY can simulate fertilization effects on SOC dynamics under different climate and soil conditions. The normalized root mean square error is less than 15% for all the treatments. Soil carbon presents various changes under different fertilization management. Treatment with straw return would enhance SOC to a relatively stable level whereas chemical fertilization affects SOC differently across the three sites. After running CENTURY over the period of 1990-2050, the SOC levels are predicted to increase from 31.8 to 52.1 Mg ha-1 across the three sites. We estimate that the carbon sequestration potential between 1990 and 2050 would be 9.4-35.7 Mg ha-1 under the current high manure application at the three sites. Analysis of SOC in each carbon pool indicates that long-term fertilization enhances the slow pool proportion but decreases the passive pool proportion. Model results suggest that change in the slow carbon pool is the major driver of the overall trends in SOC stocks under long-term fertilization.},

Using an extensive dataset of messages posted on the microblogging platform StockTwits, we construct a lexicon of words used by online investors when they share opinions and ideas about the bullishness or the bearishness of the stock market. We demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary-based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual message sentiment at half-hour intervals, we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns. After controlling for past market returns, we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half-hour S&P 500 index ETF return. Examining users' self-reported investment approach, holding period and experience level, we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders. Overall, our results provide direct empirical evidence of sentiment-driven noise trading at the intraday level.},

abstract = {The fraction of clay that disperses in water, water-dispersible clay (WDC), is recognized as an important property with respect to predicting soil erosion and colloid leaching. Using six mineralogically similar soils with 12, 18, 24, 28, 37, and 43% clay, we studied the influence of soil clay content, initial matric potential (IMP= -2.5, -100, and -15 500 hPa), and wetting rate on WDC released in response to infiltration of low–ionic strength rainwater, using a low-energy input measurement of WDC (LE-WDC). These results were referenced by WDC obtained by a conventional, high-energy input measurement based on air-dried soil (HE-WDC). The energy input in the dispersion procedure significantly affected the release of WDC. The amount of HE-WDC increased with clay content, while the amount of LE-WDC decreased with increasing clay content. The decrease in LE-WDC was explained by an increase in cohesive strength, reflected by the increase in water-stable aggregates (-4 mm). A strong dependency of IMP on LE-WDC was observed, with maximum release of LE-WDCfrom soils that were at -2.5 hPa before measurement. Decreasing soil matric potential in the period before measurement reduced LE-WDC and also reduced the dependency of soil clay content, with soils incubated at -15 500 hPa releasing a low amount of LE-WDC independent of clay content. The content of particulate organic C (POC) in the LE-WDC decreased with in- creasing clay content, and increased after drying to -15 500 hPa. Colloid dispersibility changed as a function of time and moisture status, with the main changes occurring during or immediately after adjustment of the moisture content. Increasing the wetting rate re- sulted in a doubling of the amount of LE-WDC released from the initially dry soil (-15 500 hPa), while no effect of wetting rate was observed at higher initial matric potentials},

After reviewing a range of positions relating to these assump- tions, we argue that the dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative methods is a rough and oversimplified one. Contemporary social science is dominated by commitments to research methods almost as ends in themselves, resulting in abstracted modes of empiricism based on both quantitative and qualitative methods.

abstract = {Biomass from woody crops is regarded as a future major source of renewable energy. Wood production therefore has to be enhanced to meet the energy needs of an increasing population. This can be reached by using fast-growing tree species. Grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench.) is an indigenous and fast-growing species, which is well adapted to the harsh climate of northern Europe, and could complement other biomass-oriented species used today. This study aimed to assess the potential for wood production and carbon (C) sequestration in biomass and soil of grey alder plantations under north European conditions. The estimates were based on literature data on above- and below ground biomass production, including fine roots, biomass allocation patterns and litter decomposition. By applying logistic functions on production figures and adding an estimated breeding response, grey alder would be able to produce on average 6-7 Mg ha-1 yr-1 of above ground woody biomass during a rotation up to 25 years. This would significantly contribute to increased biomass availability in the Nordic and Baltic countries when applied on agricultural land. By assuming that grey alder will mostly be used on areas suitable for the species, e.g. sites with harsh climate or moist conditions, an estimate of 560,000 ha of newly abandoned agricultural land will be available. Thus, afforestation of those areas with grey alder would result in a total annual increase of aboveground woody biomass of 3.7 Tg, corresponding to 69,000 TJ yr-1. Grey alder would also be an efficient C sink when used on newly abandoned agricultural land. Using the same areas as for biomass the annual C sequestration in biomass and soil would reach 2.6 Tg C. These figures show that grey alder has a potential to be a significant contributor for increasing biomass supply and capture C in northern Europe.},

abstract = {Quantitative description of the role of soil fauna in soil organic matter (SOM) formation and dynamics is necessary for further development of SOM modelling. This is especially true for the role of anecic earthworms in SOM formation, which was first observed in the classical investigations of Charles Darwin in 1881. Despite the large number of earthworm studies available in the literature, more attention has been paid to the role of these organisms in loss of carbon through decomposition and nutrient release than to their role in SOM formation. A set of anecic earthworm parameters were compiled or developed for ease of incorporation as a module into the SOM dynamics model Romul_Hum, which also represents the SOM forming activities of soil micro- and meso-biota. An approach was developed for initialization of earthworm biomass in the absence of measured biomass, and parameters were developed for food palatability, ingestion and egestion. The eco-physiological parameters of food consumption, excretion efficiency, assimilation efficiency, lifespan, and mortality for anecic earthworms were developed using an approach similar to that for food web mesofauna in the Romul_Hum. Parameters for processes unique to freshly excreted casts were developed to include rapid mineralization of SOM and nitrogen, SOM formation, and high nitrogen fixation rates. The addition of the earthworm module to the Romul_Hum model allows assessment of the combined effects of earthworms cast production, and micro- and meso-faunal food web activity within the casts, on the formation of stable SOM.},

Part of the problem is the emphasis on short-term studies and processes that dominate C balance at the point or soil profile scale, whereas other processes that dominate over longer timescales and larger spatial scales may actually be more important for determining the carbon balance of soils in a region. Radiocarbon is one of the only tools to study the dynamics of C in soils on decadal to millennial timescales. It provides a means for directly testing models of organic matter dynamics in ecosystems and, when measured in respired CO2 or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), provides evidence of shifts in microbial metabolism.

abstract = {Aim: Previous analyses of remotely sensed data detected the multimodality of the tree-cover distribution of the boreal forest, and identified areas with potentially alternative tree-cover states. This paper aims at investigating the causes of multimodality and multistability of the boreal forest, their influence on the asymmetric tree species distribution between Eurasia and North America, and whether multistability could be associated with recent greening trends in leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Location: Eurasian and North American boreal forests. Time period: 2000–2010. Major taxa studied: Boreal forest plant functional types. Methods: We employ a conceptual model based on tree species competition to simulate the sensitivity of tree cover to stochastic disturbances and to changes in environmental factors. We include different plant functional types based on survival adaptations, and force the model with remotely sensed environmental data. We analyse the model as a dynamical system. We use metrics from statistics and information theory to compare the detection of alternative tree-cover states and greening trends in LAI and NDVI. Results: We find that multimodality and multistability can emerge through competition between different plant functional types. Additionally, our model is able to reproduce the asymmetry in tree species distribution between Eurasia and North America. Moreover, changes in permafrost distribution can be associated with phenomenological bifurcation points of the model. Finally, we find that the detection of multistable areas is not affected by recent vegetation trends, whereas shifts between alternative states could have affected the greening trends. Main conclusions: Tree-cover multistability in the boreal region can emerge through competition between species subject to periodic disturbances. Changes in permafrost thaw and distribution could be responsible for the asymmetry in tree species distribution between North America and Eurasia. Climate change and permafrost degradation could cause shifts in tree-cover states and dominant species. Recent vegetation greening trends in multistable areas could have been affected by shifts between alternative states.},

abstract = {The "Equilibrium Model" has provided new tools for describing and investigating enzyme thermal adaptation. It has been shown that the effect of temperature on enzyme activity is not only governed by deltaG(double dagger)(cat) and deltaG(double dagger)(inact) but also by two new intrinsic parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), which describe the enthalpy and midpoint, respectively, of a reversible equilibrium between active and inactive (but not denatured) forms of enzyme. Twenty-one enzymes from organisms with a wide range of growth temperatures were characterized using the Equilibrium Model. Statistical analysis indicates that T(eq) is a better predictor of growth temperature than enzyme stability (deltaG(double dagger)(inact)). As expected from the Equilibrium Model, deltaH(eq) correlates with catalytic temperature tolerance of enzymes and thus can be declared the first intrinsic and quantitative measure of enzyme eurythermalism. Other findings shed light on the evolution of psychrophilic and thermophilic enzymes. The findings suggest that the description of the Equilibrium Model of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity applies to all enzymes regardless of their temperature origins and that its associated parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), are intrinsic and necessary parameters for characterizing the thermal properties of enzymes and their temperature adaptation and evolution.},

abstract = {Reliable and accurate methods for estimating soil mineral weathering rates are required tools in evaluating the sustainability of increased harvesting of forest biomass and assessments of critical loads of acidity. A variety of methods that differ in concept, temporal and spatial scale, and data requirements are available for measuring weathering rates. In this study, causes of discrepancies in weathering rates between methods were analysed and were classified as being either conceptual (inevitable) or random. The release rates of base cations (BCs; Ca, Mg, K, Na) by weathering were estimated in podzolised glacial tills at two experimental forest sites, Asa and Flakaliden, in southern and northern Sweden, respectively. Three different methods were used: (i) historical weathering since deglaciation estimated by the depletion method, using Zr as the assumed inert reference; (ii) steady-state weathering rate estimated with the PROFILE model, based on quantitative analysis of soil mineralogy; and (iii) BC budget at stand scale, using measured deposition, leaching and changes in base cation stocks in biomass and soil over a period of 12 years. In the 0-50&thinsp;cm soil horizon historical weathering of BCs was 10.6 and 34.1&thinsp;mmolspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"c/span&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-2/span&thinsp;yrspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-1/span, at Asa and Flakaliden, respectively. Corresponding values of PROFILE weathering rates were 37.1 and 42.7&thinsp;mmolspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"c/span&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-2/span&thinsp;yrspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-1/span. The PROFILE results indicated that steady-state weathering rate increased with soil depth as a function of exposed mineral surface area, reaching a maximum rate at 80&thinsp;cm (Asa) and 60&thinsp;cm (Flakaliden). In contrast, the depletion method indicated that the largest postglacial losses were in upper soil horizons, particularly at Flakaliden. With the exception of Mg and Ca in shallow soil horizons, PROFILE produced higher weathering rates than the depletion method, particularly of K and Na in deeper soil horizons. The lower weathering rates of the depletion method were partly explained by natural and anthropogenic variability in Zr gradients. The base cation budget approach produced significantly higher weathering rates of BCs, 134.6&thinsp;mmolspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"c/span&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-2/span&thinsp;yrspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-1/span at Asa and 73.2&thinsp;mmolspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"c/span&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-2/span&thinsp;yrspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-1/span at Flakaliden, due to high rates estimated for the nutrient elements Ca, Mg and K, whereas weathering rates were lower and similar to those for the depletion method (6.6 and 2.2&thinsp;mmolspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"c/span&thinsp;mspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-2/span&thinsp;yrspan classCombining double low line"inline-formula"-1/span at Asa and Flakaliden).

abstract = {The allocation of biomass to different plant organs depends on species, ontogeny and on the environment experienced by the plant. In this paper we first discuss some methodological tools to describe and analyse the allocation of biomass. Rather than the use of shoot:root ratios, we plead strongly for a subdivision of biomass into at least three compartments: leaves, stems and roots. Attention is drawn to some of the disadvantages of allometry as a tool to correct for size differences between plants. Second, we tested the extent to which biomass allocation of plants follows the model of a functional equilibrium. According to this model, plants respond to a decrease in above-ground resources with increased allocation to shoots (leaves), whereas they respond to a decrease in below- ground resources with increased allocation to roots. We carried out a meta-analysis of the literature, analysing the effect of various environmental variables on the fraction of total plant biomass allocated to leaves (leaf mass fraction), stem (stem mass fraction) and roots (root mass fraction). The responses to light, nutrients and water agreed with the (qualitative) prediction of the functional equilibrium theory. The notable exception was atmospheric CO2, which did not affect allocation when the concentration was doubled. Third, we analysed the quantitative importance of the changes in allocation compared to changes in other growth parameters, such as unit leaf rate (the net difference between carbon gain and carbon losses per unit time and leaf area), and specific leaf area (leaf area: leaf biomass). The effects of light, CO2 and water on leaf mass fractions were small compared to their effects on relative growth rate. The effects of nutrients, however, were large, suggesting that only in the case of nutrients, biomass allocation is a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of soil respiration (R(S)) is widely used as a key characteristic of soils or organic matter fractions within soils, and in the context of global climatic change is often applied to infer likely responses of R(S) to warmer future conditions. However, the way in which these temperature dependencies are calculated, interpreted and implemented in ecosystem models requires careful consideration of possible artefacts and assumptions. We argue that more conceptual clarity in the reported relationships is needed to obtain meaningful meta-analyses and better constrained parameters informing ecosystem models. Our critical assessment of common methodologies shows that it is impossible to measure actual temperature response of R(S), and that a range of confounding effects creates the observed apparent temperature relations reported in the literature. Thus, any measureable temperature response function will likely fail to predict effects of climate change on R(s). For improving our understanding of R(S) in changing environments we need a better integration of the relationships between substrate supply and the soil biota, and of their long-term responses to changes in abiotic soil conditions. This is best achieved by experiments combining isotopic techniques and ecosystem manipulations, which allow a disentangling of abiotic and biotic factors underlying the temperature response of soil CO(2) efflux.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {The carbon flux from woody debris, a crucial uncertainty within global carbon-climate models, is simultaneously affected by climate, site environment and species-based variation in wood quality. In the first global analysis attempting to explicitly tease out the wood quality contribution to decomposition, we found support for our hypothesis that, under a common climate, interspecific differences in wood traits affect woody debris decomposition patterns. A meta-analysis of 36 studies from all forested continents revealed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and C : N ratio correlate with decomposition rates of angiosperms. In addition, gymnosperm wood consistently decomposes slower than angiosperm wood within common sites, a pattern that correlates with clear divergence in wood traits between the two groups. New empirical studies are needed to test whether this difference is due to a direct effect of wood trait variation on decomposer activity or an indirect effect of wood traits on decomposition microsite environment. The wood trait-decomposition results point to an important role for changes in the wood traits of dominant tree species as a driver of carbon cycling, with likely feedback to atmospheric CO2 particularly where angiosperm species replace gymnosperms regionally. Truly worldwide upscaling of our results will require further site-based multi-species wood trait and decomposition data, particularly from low-latitude ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Abstract. Studies in global plant biogeography have almost exclusively analyzed re- lationships of abiotic and biotic factors with the distribution and structure of vegetation aboveground. The goal of this study was to extend such analyses to the belowground structure of vegetation by determining the biotic and abiotic factors that influence vertical root distributions in the soil, including soil, climate, and plant properties. The analysis used a database of vertical root profiles from the literature with 475 profiles from 209 geographic locations. Since most profiles were not sampled to the maximum rooting depth, several techniques were used to estimate the amount of roots at greater depths, to a maximum of 3 m in some systems. The accuracy of extrapolations was tested using a subset of deeply (?2 m) sampled or completely sampled profiles. Vertical root distributions for each profile were characterized by the interpolated 50% and 95% rooting depths (the depths above which 50% or 95% of all roots were located). General linear models incorporating plant life-form dominance, climate, and soil var- iables explained as much as 50% of the variance in rooting depths for various biomes and life-forms. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation together accounted for the largest proportion of the variance (12–16% globally and 38% in some systems). Mean 95% rooting depths increased with decreasing latitude from 80? to 30? but showed no clear trend in the tropics. Annual PET, annual precipitation, and length of the warm season were all positively correlated with rooting depths. Rooting depths in tropical veg- etation were only weakly correlated with climatic variables but were strongly correlated with sampling depths, suggesting that even after extrapolation, sampling depths there were often insufficient to characterize root profiles. Globally, ?90% of all profiles had at least 50% of all roots in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile (including organic horizons) and 95% of all roots in the upper 2 m. Deeper rooting depths were mainly found in water- limited ecosystems. Deeper 95% rooting depths were also found for shrublands compared to grasslands, in sandy soils vs. clay or loam soils, and in systems with relatively shallow organic horizons compared with deeper organic horizons},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in croplands is a crucial component of global carbon (C) cycle. Depending on local environmental conditions and management practices, typical C input is generally required to reduce or reverse C loss in agricultural soils. No studies have quantified the critical C input for maintaining SOC at global scale with high resolution. Such information will provide a baseline map for assessing soil C dynamics under potential changes in management practices and climate, and thus enable development of management strategies to reduce C footprint from farm to regional scales. We used the soil C model RothC to simulate the critical C input rates needed to maintain existing soil C level at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution in global wheat systems. On average, the critical C input was estimated to be 2.0 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, with large spatial variability depending on local soil and climatic conditions. Higher C inputs are required in wheat system of central United States and western Europe, mainly due to the higher current soil C stocks present in these regions. The critical C input could be effectively estimated using a summary model driven by current SOC level, mean annual temperature, precipitation, and soil clay content. {\textcopyright} 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

They did prefer all the common sub canopy tree species, and these comprised the bulk of diet in all habitats. Broadleaf (Griselinia littoralis) was the most important single food, with litterfall being its dominant source. The most important non-woody foods were lichen and fungi (beech forest) and introduced grasses (exotic forest). Total forage availability did not differ between habitats (590 {\c{a}}148 kg of dry matter ha-1), but composition did. Preferred foods (other than the introduced grasses) were scarce, particularly in the beech forest. A comparison of probable food production and use within the browse zone indicated that, at present densities, deer were not likely to prevent regeneration of the less preferred species (including silver beech). In the beech forest, regeneration of most sub canopy tree species will be minimal while deer densities remain near present levels (0.1 deer ha-1). However, the biomass of silver beech, shrubs, ferns, lichen, and fungi appears adequate to sustain the current deer population even if most of the preferred tree species disappear.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine 3 different models used to estimate turnover of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions using radiocarbon measurements: one conventional carbon dating model and two bomb 14C models. One of the bomb 14C models uses an atmospheric 14C record for the period 22,050 BC to AD 2003 and is solved by numerical methods, while the other assumes a constant 14C content of the atmosphere and is solved analytically. The estimates of SOC turnover obtained by the conventional 14C dating model differed substantially from those obtained by the bomb 14C models, which we attribute to the simplifying assumption of the conventional 14C model that the whole SOC fraction is of the same age. The assumptions underlying the bomb 14C models are more applicable to SOC fractions; therefore, the calculated turnover times are considered to be more reliable. We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the uncertainties of the turnover times calculated with the numerically solved 14C model, accounting not only for measurement errors but also for uncertainties introduced from assumptions of constant input and uncertainties in the 14C content of the CO2 assimilated by plants. The resulting uncertainties depend on systematic deviations in the atmospheric 14C record for SOC fractions with a fast turnover. Therefore, the use of the bomb 14C models can be problematic when SOC fractions with a fast turnover are analyzed, whereas the relative uncertainty of the turnover estimates turned out to be smaller than 30% when the turnover time of the SOC fractions analyzed was longer than 30 yr, and smaller than 15% when the turnover time was longer than 100 yr.},

abstract = {Assessment of net primary productivity of maize (Zea mays L)-based agroecosystems is dependent on both above and belowground dry matter production that is ultimately returned to the soil as residue and decaying roots. Root to shoot ratio (R/S) is a parameter often used to estimate root biomass (RB) when shoot biomass is measured or estimated. The labor intensive nature of root sampling and wide variety of sampling techniques has lead to a paucity of maize RB data in the literature, and few researchers have endeavored to characterize R/S throughout an entire growing season. In this paper, the results of 45 maize root studies published in 41 journal articles are summarized and the data used to generate estimates of maize RB and R/S versus days after emergence (DAE). The data from these studies indicate that on average, RB was maximized just after anthesis at approximately 31 g plant-1 (13.6 g C plant-1) and that average R/S varied from a high of 0.68 at emergence to a low of 0.16 at physiological maturity. Net rhizodeposited C as a percentage of total net root-derived belowground C at time of sampling (%NRC) was reported for 12 maize studies and varied between 5 and 62%. The wide variation in the %NRC was shown to be highly correlated with an index combining irradiance level, photoperiod, and ambient temperature, suggesting a strong dependence of net rhizodeposited C on rate of photosynthesis and soil respiration. The net belowground C deposition at maize physiological maturity is estimated as 29 ± 13% of shoot biomass C for maize that has not experienced stress.},

abstract = {Parameterizations of aerodynamic resistance to heat and water transfer have a significant impact on the accuracy of models of land – atmosphere interactions and of estimated surface fluxes using spectro-radiometric data collected from aircrafts and satellites. We have used measurements from an eddy correlation system to derive the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer over a bare soil surface as well as over a maize canopy. Diurnal variations of aerodynamic resistance have been analyzed. The results showed that the diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance during daytime (07:00 h–18:00 h) was significant for both the bare soil surface and the maize canopy although the range of variation was limited. Based on the measurements made by the eddy correlation system, a comprehensive evaluation of eight popularly used parameterization schemes of aerodynamic resistance was carried out. The roughness length for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in the estimation of aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer and can neither be taken as a constant nor be neglected. Comparing with the measurements, the parameterizations by Choudhury et al. (1986), Viney (1991), Yang et al. (2001) and the modified forms of Verma et al. (1976) and Mahrt and Ek (1984) by inclusion of roughness length for heat transfer gave good agreements with the measurements, while the parameterizations by Hatfield et al. (1983) and Xie (1988) showed larger errors even though the roughness length for heat transfer has been taken into account.},

abstract = {Globally, grasslands are a major land cover type and store significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Fertilization with the major plant nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) may affect SOC stocks, e.g., by altering aboveground and belowground plant productivity, species composition, litter composition and decomposition, and microbial metabolism. However, belowground responses to fertilization in grasslands are not fully understood, hampering accurate predictions of SOC dynamics. In this study, seven different long-term grassland fertilization experiments (16–58 years) in Germany and the Netherlands were sampled to determine the effects of mineral fertilization (i.e., N, P, K, PK, and NPK) compared with unfertilized plots (Control) on SOC stocks and root C stocks. Soils were sampled to a depth of 100 cm or to the maximum depth possible. Potential litter decomposition was assessed using Lipton Rooibos and Lipton Green teas as standardized and well-characterized litter materials. In the topsoil (0–30 cm depth), PK, NPK, and NPK+ (increased NPK) fertilization had significant positive effects on SOC stocks, with annual sequestration rates of 0.28, 0.13, and 0.37 Mg ha−1yr−1, respectively, within an average time span of 34 (PK, NPK) or 20 (NPK+) years. For NPK fertilization, 1.15 kg of N was needed to sequester 1 kg SOC. Increased SOC stocks could not be explained by altered belowground C inputs or decomposition rates, since root C stocks were not affected by fertilization and potential litter decomposition was unchanged. The highly significant increases in dry matter yield with PK and NPK fertilization and resulting higher aboveground C inputs were also unlikely to explain the observed SOC stock changes, since increases were only observed at soil depths >10 cm. However, significantly narrower root C:N ratios were observed for the N (26.9), PK (36.5), NPK (36.8), and NPK+ (33.2) treatments than for the Control (41.8), which may have caused increased microbial C use efficiency, positively affecting SOC storage. The narrower C:N ratios in PK treatments were explained by significantly increased abundance of legumes. We concluded that the carbon footprint of fertilization-induced SOC sequestration needs to be considered when the latter should be accounted for as a climate mitigation measure. Thereby, PK fertilization has much lower CO2costs than NPK fertilization due to N input via legumes.},

abstract = {Larger, and deeper, root systems of new maize varieties, compared to older varieties, are thought to have enabled improved acquisition of soil resources and, consequently, greater grain yields. To compare the spatial distributions of the root systems of new and old maize varieties and their relationships with spatial variations in soil concentrations of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), two years of field experiments were performed using six Chinese maize varieties released in different eras. Vertical distributions of roots, and available N, P and K in the 0-60 cm soil profile were determined in excavated soil monoliths at silking and maturity. The results demonstrated that new maize varieties had larger root dry weight, higher grain yield and greater nutrient accumulation than older varieties. All varieties had similar total root length and vertical root distribution at silking, but newer varieties maintained greater total root length and had more roots in the 30-60 cm soil layers at maturity. The spatial variation of soil mineral N (Nmin) in each soil horizon was larger than that of Olsen-P and ammonium-acetate-extractable K, and was inversely correlated with root length density (RLD), especially in the 0-20 cm soil layer. It was concluded that greater acquisition of mineral nutrients and higher yields of newer varieties were associated with greater total root length at maturity. The negative relationship between RLD and soil Nmin at harvest for all varieties suggests the importance of the spatial distribution of the root system for N uptake by maize.},

Successful Climate-Smart Forestry has important policy implications on finding the right balance between short and long-term goals, as well as between the need for wood production, the protection of biodiversity and the provision of other important ecosystem services.

abstract = {Temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere cover an area of about 2 × 107 square kilometres and act as a substantial carbon sink (0.6-0.7 petagrams of carbon per year). Although forest expansion following agricultural abandonment is certainly responsible for an important fraction of this carbon sink activity, the additional effects on the carbon balance of established forests of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures, changes in management practices and nitrogen deposition are difficult to disentangle, despite an extensive network of measurement stations. The relevance of this measurement effort has also been questioned, because spot measurements fail to take into account the role of disturbances, either natural (fire, pests, windstorms) or anthropogenic (forest harvesting). Here we show that the temporal dynamics following stand-replacing disturbances do indeed account for a very large fraction of the overall variability in forest carbon sequestration. After the confounding effects of disturbance have been factored out, however, forest net carbon sequestration is found to be overwhelmingly driven by nitrogen deposition, largely the result of anthropogenic activities. The effect is always positive over the range of nitrogen deposition covered by currently available data sets, casting doubts on the risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation under natural conditions. The results demonstrate that mankind is ultimately controlling the carbon balance of temperate and boreal forests, either directly (through forest management) or indirectly (through nitrogen deposition). {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections. The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type. Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(+7)(-4) years (95 per cent confidence interval). On average, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75° north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semi-arid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.},

@article{Ratkowsky1982,
abstract = {The Arrhenius Law, which was originally proposed to describe the temperature dependence of the specific reaction rate constant in chemical reactions, does not adequately describe the effect of temperature on bacterial growth. Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between the square root ofgrowth rate constant (r) and temperature (7), namely, V;-= b (T -To), where b is the regres-sion coefficient and To is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds. Van't Hoff (27) and Arrhenius (2), by analogy to the Van't Hoff thermodynamic equation for chemical equilibrium, put forward the concept that the rate constant for chemical reactions might be suitably described by the following expression in differential form: d ln k/dT = E/RT2 (1) where k is the specific reaction rate constant (or simply the rate constant), R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and E is an empirically determined quantity called the activation energy. Upon integration, equation 1 results in the following exponential form: k = A exp (-EIRT) (2) where the constant A is referred to variously as the "collision factor" or "frequency factor" (16). Equation 2 has become generally known as the Arrhenius Law, and this expression has had some notable success in describing the tempera-ture dependence of chemical reactions. In microbiology, it has been recognized that temperature is also a cardinal factor controlling the rate of development of microbial popula-tions, and microbiologists have simply substitut-ed growth rate constant r, which is determined assuming an exponential growth model and which is also the reciprocal of the generation time, for rate constant k in equation 2 and have replaced E by a quantity , which they have called the temperature characteristic. However, although , is supposed to be a constant in equation 2, there is widespread recognition that it is in fact a decreasing function of temperature (3, 13, 23). The consequence of this is that when In r is plotted against reciprocal temperature lIT to produce what is commonly known as an Arrhenius plot, a curve is obtained instead of a straight line. This is readily observed for the six data sets depicted in Fig. 1. This figure, which represents five bacteria and a mold, was re-drawn from Johnson et al. (13); it is quite clear that the data do not even remotely approximate a straight-line relationship at any portion of the range. In a more recent paper, Mohr and Krawiec (17) claim that some of their Arrhenmus plots show two distinct slopes, but inspection of their Fig. 1 to 3 reveals continuous downward-trending curves for each of their data sets throughout the whole suboptimal temperature range. The curves of growth rate constant versus temperature as drawn in Fig. 1 are very typical of data for bacterial cultures, as Arrhenius plots of data obtained in the present study (Table 1) and those derived from the literature (Table 2) are all characterized by a continuously changing slope between the minimum and optimum tem-peratures. A poor fit is generally obtained if one tries to fit the Arrhenius Law to such data, as the response deviates from the linear relationship predicted by equation 2. Laidler (15) has pointed},

abstract = {Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and represent both an important stock of soil car- bon and a substantial natural source of relevant greenhouse gases likeCO2 andCH4. While it is known that the quality of organic matter affects microbial degradation and mineralization processes in peatlands, the manner in which the quality of peat organic matter affects the formation of CO2 and CH4 remains unclear. In this study we developed a fast and sim- ple peat quality index in order to estimate its potential green- house gas formation by linking the thermo-degradability of peat with potential anaerobic CO2 and CH4 formation rates. Peat samples were obtained at several depths (0–40 cm) at four sampling locations from an acidic fen (pH∼4.7). CO2 and CH4 formation rates were highly spatially variable and depended on depth, sampling location, and the composi- tion of pyrolysable organic matter. Peat samples active in CO2 and CH4 formation had a quality index above 1.35, and the fraction of thermally labile pyrolyzable organic matter (compable to easily available carbon substrates for microbial activity) obtained by thermogravimetry was above 35%. Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrome- try mainly identified carbohydrates and lignin as pyrolysis products in these samples, indicating that undecomposed or- ganic matterwas found in this fraction. In contrast, lipids and unspecific pyrolysis products, which indicate recalcitrant and highly decomposed organic matter, correlated significantly with lower CO2 formation and reduced methanogenesis. Our results suggest that undecomposed organic matter is a prereq- uisite for CH4 and CO2 development in acidic fens. Further- more, the new peat quality index should aide the estimation of potential greenhouse gas formation resulting from peat- land restoration and permafrost thawing and help yield more robust models of trace gas fluxes from peatlands for climate change},

abstract = {Society relies on Earth system models (ESMs) to project future climate and carbon (C) cycle feedbacks. However, the soil C response to climate change is highly uncertain in these models1,2 and they omit key biogeochemical mechanisms3–5. Specifically, the traditional approach in ESMs lacks direct microbial control over soil C dynamics6–8. Thus, we tested a new model that explicitly represents microbial mechanisms of soil C cycling on the global scale. Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2 or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks.},

abstract = {Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).},

abstract = {Growth, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen allocation between roots, stems, leaves and grains were measured and simulated in winter wheat on a clay soil in three treatments including daily irrigation and fertilization. Special emphasis was placed on biomass and nitrogen allocation within the crop and on the availability of soil nitrogen for crop growth. The model used for the simulations of growth (SOILN-CROP), which was driven by a hydrological model, is based on the light interception concept and empirical allometric functions. Growth is the driving force for nitrogen uptake, which is limited by the availability of mineral N in the soil. The model was calibrated for one treatment. Thereafter, the same parameter set was used to simulate the other two treatments. Frequent irrigation in combination with single-dose fertilization increased crop growth and N leaching compared with the non-irrigated but single-dose fertilized control, whereas irrigation together with daily fertilization increased crop growth and N uptake but not N leaching. Simulated soil mineral N levels agreed well with measurements on a 1-year time scale. Assimilate allocation to roots decreased logarithmically with total crop biomass in all treatments. Allocation to leaves decreased linearly with total above-ground crop mass. The crop availability of mineral N differed considerably between treatments. The model parameter defining the proportion of soil mineral N available for plant uptake had a strong influence on model behaviour. This proportion is indicated to depend on soil water content and the mechanisms of this relation need to be considered in future work to improve our predictions of N uptake.

abstract = {Discovering why natural population densities change over time and vary with location is a central goal of ecological and evolutional disciplines. The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists. However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator-prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.},

abstract = {Intensive extraction of forest resources lowers biodiversity and endangers the functioning of forest ecosystems. As such, alternative management regimes have emerged, aspiring to promote forest biodiversity and nature protection in managed forests. Among them, continuous cover forestry, (i.e. selective logging), has received considerable attention and is being promoted by some researchers and NGOs. Yet, the full consequences of banning clear-cuts (i.e. rotation forestry) and replacing it entirely with continuous cover forest remains uncertain. We explore how restricting forest management alternatives (either rotation forestry or continuous cover forestry) will affect landscape-scale forest multifunctionality at a range of harvesting levels. We evaluate multifunctionality as a combination of recreational ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, habitat availability for vertebrates, and red-listed dead wood dependent species. Our results show that restricting forest management alternatives have a negative impact on forest multifunctionality at all harvesting levels when compared to the case with no restrictions. Using only continuous cover forestry management alternatives resulted in higher multifunctionality than the case when only rotation forestry management alternatives were used. We also show that maximizing multifunctionality using all management alternatives led to high proportion of continuous cover forestry over the landscape. We conclude that banning clear-cuts does not promote forest biodiversity and multifunctionality at the landscape scale, especially if there is a requirement for high economic benefits from the forest. However, we recommend that continuous cover forestry should be considered as a primary management alternative, with selective application of rotation forestry wisely planned at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {The herbicide, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is extensively used worldwide. Long-term use of glyphosate can cause micronutrient deficiency but little is known about potassium (K) interactions with glyphosate. The repeated use of glyphosate may create a selection pressure in soil microbial communities that could affect the nutrient dynamics such as K. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of single or repeated glyphosate applications on microbial and K properties of soils. A 54 day incubation study (Exp I) had a 3 ?? 5 factorial design with 3 soils (silt loam: fine, illitic, mesic Aeric Epiaqualf) of similar physical and chemical characteristics, that varied in long-term glyphosate applications (no, low, and high glyphosate field treatments) and five glyphosate rates (0, 0.5??, 1??, 2??, and 3?? recommended field rates applied once at time zero). A second 6 month incubation study (Exp II) had a 3 ?? 3 factorial design with three soils (as described above) and three rates of glyphosate (0, 1??, and 2?? recommended field application rates applied monthly). For each study microbial properties [respiration; community structure measured by ester linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) analysis and microbial biomass K] and K fractions (exchangeable and non-exchangeable) were measured periodically. For Exp I, glyphosate significantly increased microbial respiration that was closely related to glyphosate application rate, most notably in soils with a history of receiving glyphosate. For Exp II, there was no significant effect of repeated glyphosate application on soil microbial structure (EL-FAME) or biomass K. We conclude that glyphosate: (1) stimulates microbial respiration particularly on soils with a history of glyphosate application; (2) has no significant effect on functional diversity (EL-FAME) or microbial biomass K; and (3) does not reduce the exchangeable K (putatively available to plants) or affect non-exchangeable K. The respiration response in soils with a long-term glyphosate response would suggest there was a shift in the microbial community that could readily degrade glyphosate but this shift was not detected by EL-FAME. ?? 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Soil microbial communities are so vastly diverse that complex interactions, which alter ecosystem functions, may occur among microbial species and functional groups. In this review, we explore the empirical evidence for situations when shifts in the community structure of microbes would elicit a change in ecosystem process rates, specifically decomposition, even when microbial biomass remains constant. In particular, we are interested in??a??subset of these scenarios in which knowledge of microbial community structure would improve model predictions for ecosystem functions. Results from microcosm and field studies indicate that microbial species diversity, functional group diversity, and community composition can all influence ecosystem process rates. The underlying mechanisms that may elicit changes in ecosystem functions from shifts in microbial community structure include evolutionary constraints on microbial trait adaptation, trait correlations, dispersal limitation, and species interactions. The extent of microbial diversity in soils is not known, so it is presently not possible to??model all scenarios of microbial community structure shifts. However, by incorporating documented patterns in functional groups that are relevant for a particular ecosystem process and potential relationships between microbial phylogeny and function, the predictive power of process models will be significantly improved. The inclusion of this information into process models is critical for predicting and understanding how ecosystem functions may shift in response to global change. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Few studies have examined the influence of natural disturbances, such as windthrow, on soil organic matter formation, stabilization, and loss in soils. In shallow (< 1 m) mountain forest soils, windthrow activity may result in the redistribution and mixing of mineral and organic soil horizons down to bedrock. We studied the patterns of soil carbon, the dominant constituent of soil organic matter, in watersheds along a windthrow disturbance sequence in a mountainous temperate rain forest in southeast Alaska. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the influence of windthrow and illuviation on the accumulation of soil organic carbon in mineral horizons and (2) to compare the forms of soil organic matter that have accumulated. Soils were described, and the thickness of the major organic and mineral horizons was measured, every 5 in along transects in three watersheds with contrasting windthrow histories. A subset of the soil description sites was randomly selected and then sampled to determine the quantity and quality of soil carbon. Mineral soil samples were physically fractionated based on particle density. Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), natural (15)N and (13)C abundance, micromorphologic analysis (using scanning electron microscopy), and solid-state (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to compare soil organic matter pools in the three watersheds. The Bh horizon heavy-fraction (>1.65 g/cml) C pools decreased from 25 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 3 Mg/ha in the most disturbed watershed; whereas light-fraction C pools were similar (4-6 Mg/ha) across all watersheds. Soil C stocks decreased from 216 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 157 Mg/ha in the most disturbed watersheds. Evidence was found that mobile organic carbon transported in soil water accumulated in mineral horizons principally through sorption to mineral particles. Strong association with mineral particles was greater in the thicker, presumably older, illuvial horizons. We found light amorphous material in some of these thicker illuvial horizons, suggesting that mobile organic carbon may have been immobilized through flocculation of metal-bearing organic acids. Watersheds that experienced more intense soil mixing from windthrow had lower levels of strongly humified soil organic matter, and more in a partially decomposed particulate form.},

abstract = {Deadwood decay is an important ecosystem process in forest ecosystems, but the relative contribution of specific wood properties of tree species, activities of wood-degrading enzymes, and decomposer communities such as fungi and insects is unclear. We ask whether wood properties, in particular differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and organismic diversity of colonizers contribute to wood decomposition. To test this, we exposed deadwood logs of 13 tree species, covering four gymnosperms and nine angiosperm species, in 30 plots under different forest management in three regions in Germany. After a decomposition time of 6.5 years Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica showed the highest decay rates. We found a positive correlation of decay rate with enzyme activities, chemical wood properties (S, K concentration) and organismic diversity, while, heartwood character, lignin content, extractive concentration and phenol content were negatively correlated with decay rate across all 13 tree species. By applying a multi-model inference approach we found that the activity of the wood-degrading enzymes laccase and endocellulase, beetle diversity, heartwood presence, wood ray height and fungal diversity were the most important predictor variables for wood decay. Although we were not able to identify direct cause and effect relations by our approach, we conclude that enzyme activity and organismic diversity are the main drivers of wood decay rate, which greatly differed among tree species. Maintaining high tree species diversity will therefore result in high structural deadwood diversity in terms of decay rate and decay stage.},

Kinetic and stoichiometric constraints on microbial growth suggest that CUE in multi-resource limited natural systems should approach $\sim$ 0.3 (CUE max /2). However, the mean CUE values reported for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems differ by twofold ($\sim$ 0.26 vs. $\sim$ 0.55) because the methods used to estimate CUE in aquatic and terrestrial systems generally differ and soil estimates are less likely to capture the full maintenance costs of community metabolism given the difficulty of measurements in water-limited environments. Moreover, many simulation models lack adequate representation of energy spilling pathways and stoichiometric constraints on metabolism, which can also lead to overestimates of CUE. We recommend that broad-scale models use a CUE value of 0.30, unless there is evidence for lower values as a result of pervasive nutrient limitations. Ecosystem models operating at finer scales should consider resource composition, stoichiometric constraints and biomass composition, as well as environmental drivers, to predict the CUE of microbial communities.},

abstract = {At the global level, maize is the third most important crop on the basis of harvested area. Given its importance, an assessment of the variation in regional climatic suitability under climate change is critical. CliMond 10′ data were used to model the potential current and future climate distribution of maize at the global level using the CLIMEX distribution model with climate data from two general circulation models, CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H, assuming an A2 emissions scenario for 2050 and 2100. The change in area under future climate was analysed at continental level and for major maize-producing countries of the world. Regions between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn indicate the highest loss of climatic suitability, contrary to poleward regions that exhibit an increase of suitability. South America shows the highest loss of climatic suitability, followed by Africa and Oceania. Asia, Europe and North America exhibit an increase in climatic suitability. This study indicates that globally, large areas that are currently suitable for maize cultivation will suffer from heat and dry stresses that may constrain production. For the first time, a model was applied worldwide, allowing for a better understanding of areas that are suitable and that may remain suitable for maize.},

In spite of being criticised by many, there is a growing interest in using them also outside central Europe in order to analyse trends of change in the vegetation and their underlying environmental variables. Various aspects of indicator values are reviewed: their main features, the most important applications (notably the use of weighted site averages), problems and pitfalls of indicator analyses, the relationship between weighted site averages and measurements as well as their extension to other regions. Some aspects are illustrated using data sets of forest plots from S Sweden. Provided that the limitations of indicator values are recognised, these have a high reliability and can complement or, in some cases, replace measurements to determine the values of environmental variables and to monitor their change.},

abstract = {Disturbance from human recreational activities may affect the nutrition of free-ranging herbivores due to trade-offs between feeding in preferred habitats and perceived predation risk. To test this hypothesis, we estimated diet composition for red deer in the Scottish highlands in spring, when recreational activity tends to be high, and in winter when it is lower. We analysed faecal samples from three habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) collected at sites close to a busy track (disturbed) and at a distance from it (less disturbed). The diet consisted of 39% grasses, sedges, herbs and rushes (GSHR) and 58% Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp. (heather) in spring, compared with 14% grasses and 77% heather in winter, with small quantities of Vaccinium spp. (berry) and Pinus sylvestris (tree) in both seasons. In spring, faeces from disturbed grass and woodland sites indicated a diet with less GSHR and more heather and tree than faeces from less-disturbed sites, which could be due to an increased need for vigilance in exposed grassland and the need to seek cover. In contrast, faeces from all disturbed sites in winter indicated a diet with more GSHR and less heather than faeces from less-disturbed sites. This could be due to a seasonal decline in recreation and increase in hunting activity reversing the disturbance levels at the different sites, since hunting is not normally carried out in areas used by the public for recreation. We conclude that there may be nutritional benefits to deer of reducing disturbance near open grassland.},

abstract = {Aim: The relationship between erosion and biodiversity is reciprocal. Soil organisms can both reduce soil loss, by improving porosity, and increase it, by diminishing soil stability as a result of their mixing activities. Simultaneously, soil runoff has ecological impacts on belowground communities. Despite clear research into interactions, soil erosion models do not consider biodiversity in their estimates and soil ecology has poorly investigated the effects of erosion. In order to start filling in these research gaps, we present a novel biological factor and introduce it into a well-known soil erosion model (the revised universal soil loss equation). Furthermore, we propose insights to advance soil erosion ecology. Location: Pan-European. Time period: Simulation of present-day conditions. Major taxa studied: Earthworms. Methods: We present three pathways to fill in current knowledge gaps in soil biodiversity and erosion studies: (a) introducing a biological factor into soil erosion models ; (b) developing plot-scale experiments to clarify and quantify the positive/negative effects of soil organisms on erosion; (c) promoting ecological studies to assess both short-and long-term effects of soil erosion on soil biota. Results: We develop a biological factor to be included in soil erosion modelling. Thanks to available data on earthworm diversity (richness and abundance), we generate an "earthworm factor", incorporate it into a model of soil erosion and produce the first pan-European maps of it. Main conclusions: New estimates of soil loss can be generated by including biological factors in soil erosion models. At the same time, the effects of soil loss on below-ground diversity require further investigation. Available data and technologies make both processes possible. We think that it is time to commit to fostering the fundamental , although complex, relationship between soil biodiversity and erosion.

Here, we assess the extent to which such applications take place. By using Sweden as a case study, we demonstrate fundamental differences among biogeographical regions in natural patterns and processes, past land-use, and anthropogenic impacts that need to be better incorporated into strategic conservation planning and decisions. Furthermore, assessment of specific forestry regulations and biogeographical variation in a number of other countries/provinces embracing boreal and temperate biomes also indicate that natural boundaries are insufficiently considered in forest management policies. We suggest that a substantial potential exists to better align conservation priorities with biogeographical characteristics. To illustrate the application of such an approach, we present a decision support model on how forest conservation policies that rest on natural boundaries and ecological processes can be developed.},

abstract = {Process-based models are powerful tools for sustainable and adaptive forest management. Bayesian statistics and global sensitivity analysis allow to reduce uncertainties in parameters and outputs, and they provide better insight of model behaviour. In this work two versions of a process-based model that differed in the autotrophic respiration modelling were analysed. The original version (3PGN) was based on a constant ratio between net and gross primary production, while in a new version (3PGN*) the autotrophic respiration was modelled as a function of temperature and biomass. A Bayesian framework, and a global sensitivity analysis (Morris method) were used to reduce parametric uncertainty, to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the models and to evaluate their performances. The Bayesian approach allowed also to identify the weaknesses and strengths of the dataset used for the analyses. The Morris method in combination with the Bayesian framework helped to identify key parameters and gave a deeper understanding of model behaviour. Both model versions reliably predicted average stand diameter at breast height, average stand height, stand volume and stem biomass. On the contrary, the models were not able to accurately predict net ecosystem production. Bayesian model comparison showed that 3PGN*, with the new autotrophic respiration model, has a higher conditional probability of being correct than the original 3PGN model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are used to simulate from complex statistical distributions by way of a local exploration of these distributions. This local feature avoids heavy requests on understanding the nature of the target, but it also potentially induces a lengthy exploration of this target, with a requirement on the number of simulations that grows with the dimension of the problem and with the complexity of the data behind it. Several techniques are available toward accelerating the convergence of these Monte Carlo algorithms, either at the exploration level (as in tempering, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and partly deterministic methods) or at the exploitation level (with Rao–Blackwellization and scalable methods).

abstract = {We examined fine root turnover using both the minirhizotron and radiocarbon methods within the organic horizon of a northern hardwood forest to better understand discrepancies in turnover estimates obtained using these methods. The recently developed radiocarbon method estimates the mean age of organic matter by comparing its radio- carbon content to recorded atmospheric radiocarbon levels, which peaked in the 1960s as a result of thermonuclear weapons testing. The radiocarbon content of fine roots harvested from minirhizotron tubes did not differ from that of roots collected from the soil, suggesting these two methods sampled the same population of fine roots. However, long- term observation of fine root survivorship using minirhizotrons showed that root age distribution is positively skewed, causing systematic overestimation of fine root turnover by the minirhizotron method and underestimation by the radio- carbon method. We developed a parametric regression model of fine root survivorship. Our estimate of fine root turn- over (about 30% per year) using this variation of the minirhizotron method was supported by radiocarbon data considered in conjunction with fine root age distribution.},

abstract = {Aim To review published evidence regarding the factors that influence the geo- graphic variation in diversity of soil organisms at different spatial scales. Location Global. Methods A search of the relevant literature was conducted using the Web of Science and the author's personal scientific database as the major sources. Special attention was paid to include seminal studies, highly cited papers and/or studies highlighting novel results. Results Despite their significant contribution to global biodiversity, our taxo- nomic knowledge of soil biota is still poor compared with that of most above- ground organisms. This is particularly evident for small-bodied taxa. Global patterns of soil biodiversity distribution have been poorly documented and are thought to differ significantly from what is reported above-ground. Based on exist- ing data, it appears that microorganisms do not respond to large-scale environ- mental gradients in the same way as metazoans. Whereas soil microflora seem to be mainly represented by cosmopolitan species, soil animals respond to altitudinal, latitudinal or area gradients in the same way as described for above-ground organ- isms. At local scales, there is less evidence that local factors regulate above- and below-ground communities in the same way. Except for a few taxa, the hump- backed response to stress and disturbance gradients doesn't seem to apply under- ground. Soil communities thus appear weakly structured by competition, although competitive constraints may account for assembly rules within specific taxa. The main factor constraining local soil biodiversity is the compact and heterogeneous nature of soils, which provides unrivalled potential for niche partitioning, thus allowing high levels of local biodiversity. This heterogeneity is increased by the impact of ecosystem engineers that generate resource patchiness at a range of spatio-temporal scales.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter models with complex ecological mechanisms usually include a large number of parameters than simpler models that omit detailed processes. Finding parameter values for these complex models is challenging given the poor availability of comprehensive datasets that describe different processes. Depending on the type of data available, the estimation of parameters in complex models may lead to identifiability problems, i.e. obtaining different combinations of parameters that give equally good predictions in comparison with the observed data. In this manuscript, we explore the problem of identifiability in soil organic matter models, pointing out combinations of empirical data and model structure that can minimize identifiability issues. We found that only sets of up to 3 or 4 parameters may be uniquely identifiable, depending on the number of data constrains used for parameter identification. When only using data on soil respiration fluxes from soil incubations or mass loss from litter decay studies, up to 2 parameters can be uniquely identifiable independently on the model structure. For nonlinear microbial models, all parameters cannot be identified simultaneously with mass loss or respiration data, combined with additional constraints from isotopes. Parameter identifiability possess series challenges for proposing complex model structures in global soil carbon models given the limitation of comprehensive datasets at a global scale.},

abstract = {Earlier research has suggested that the diversification of silvicultural strategies is a cost-efficient tool to ensure multifunctionality in production forests. This study compared the effects of continuous cover forestry and conventional rotation forestry on ecosystem services and biodiversity in boreal forests in Finland. We simulated over 25,000 commercial forest stands for 100 years under continuous cover and rotation forest management. Forests without management were used as a reference. We compared the effects of silvicultural practices over space and time on ecosystem services, biodiversity indicators and multifunctionality. Our results revealed that continuous cover forestry was better than rotation forest management in terms of timber net present value, carbon sequestration, bilberry production, scenic beauty and the number of large trees. It provided higher habitat availability for indicator species dependent on deciduous trees and mature forest structure. Rotation forest management was better than continuous cover forestry in terms of harvested tree biomass, cowberries, mushrooms, and species dependent on high tree volume. In general, multifunctionality was higher in continuous cover forests than in rotation forests. Therefore, continuous cover forests may have a greater potential to produce simultaneously multiple benefits from forests. However, unmanaged forests often provided the highest levels of services and biodiversity making their role indispensable in delivering forest related ecosystem services and, especially, in the maintenance of biodiversity. Continuous cover forestry does not itself guarantee the maintenance of all ecosystem services and biodiversity in commercial forests but it can be an important part of a successful progression towards more sustainable forestry.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal mycelial necromass is an important source of carbon for free-living microorganisms in forest soils, yet we know little either of its fate when it enters soil or of the identity of microbes that are able to utilise mycelium as their energy source. Here we used 13C-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in bulk soil 13C concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and chitin-glucan during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium was rapidly turned over. Further, 13C was incorporated into fungal DNA within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extra-matrical mycelium is an important source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Methods for measuring soil microbial biomass C were reviewed. The basic ideas behind the fumiga- tion-incubation method, the fumigation-extraction method, the substrate-induced respiration method, and the ATP method were examined together with the advan- tages, disadvantages, and limitations as reported in the literature and those found by our own recent investiga- tions. The fumigation-incubation method is the basic tech- nique which is also used for calibration of the three other methods. It is characterized by simple performance with- out the need of expensive equipment. Its application is limited to soils with a pH above 5 and to soils that do not contain easily degradable C sources. If these limitations are not considered, too low or even negative biomass val- ues will be obtained. These restrictions are largely over- come by the fumigation-extraction method. However, the kEc factor applied to calculate microbial biomass C from the C additionally made extractable by the fumiga- tion is still controversial. The substrate-induced respira- tion requires expensive equipment for the hourly mea- surement of soil respiration. This method is also suscepti- ble to amendment of soils with C sources, leading to an overestimate of biomass C. Although a few authors dis- agree with some basic assumptions behind the methods described, they are widely used and accepted. The use of ATP to measure biomass C in soil is far more uncertain. A high diversity of applied techniques for the extraction and measurement of ATP has led to biomass C : ATP ra- tios which vary between about 150 and 1000. Our own current investigations are expected to shed more light on the problems of ATP extraction. Preliminary results indi- cate that a constant biomass C:ATP ratio of about 200 may be more realistic.},

In this scenario, the role of non-crop elements such as weeds and semi-natural habitats is crucial for enhancing natural enemy abundance and therefore supporting biocontrol effect. The aim of the research was to evaluate the correlation between presence of arthropods and plant species composing non-crop elements. Biocontrol was evaluated depending on: (1) distances from field margins, (2) management of the system and (3) period of sampling. An analysis of plant, with associated functional traits, and arthropods (4) was performed to identify which plant species likely support predators. Main findings highlighted an overall similarity between samples collected in different periods and spots. This is likely explained by the relatively small size of the experimental site with resulting strong interactions among all the systems and a strong influence of the surrounding landscape on arthropod biodiversity. However, the biocontrol effect was found to be high even in the farther spots from the margins, in every system and over the whole sampling period. In conclusion, Cirsium arvensis resulted to be the plant species associated with a higher abundance of predators.},

abstract = {Drained organic soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils may reduce GHG emissions and could also create suitable conditions for return of the carbon (C) sink function characteristic of undrained organic soils. In this article we expand on the work relating to rewetted organic soils that was carried out for the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement. We describe the methods and scientific approach used to derive the Tier 1 emission factors (the rate of emission per unit of activity) for the full suite of GHG and waterborne C fluxes associated with rewetting of organic soils. We recorded a total of 352 GHG and waterborne annual flux data points from an extensive literature search and these were disaggregated by flux type (i.e. CO2, CH4, N2O and DOC), climate zone and nutrient status. Our results showed fundamental differences between the GHG dynamics of drained and rewetted organic soils and, based on the 100 year global warming potential of each gas, indicated that rewetting of drained organic soils leads to: net annual removals of CO2 in the majority of organic soil classes; an increase in annual CH4 emissions; a decrease in N2O and DOC losses; and a lowering of net GHG emissions. Data published since the Wetlands Supplement (n = 58) generally support our derivations. Significant data gaps exist, particularly with regard to tropical organic soils, DOC and N2O. We propose that the uncertainty associated with our derivations could be significantly reduced by the development of country specific emission factors that could in turn be disaggregated by factors such as vegetation composition, water table level, time since rewetting and previous land use history.},

Yet, despite ancillary data supporting a positive feedback, there is limited evidence for soil carbon loss under warming. The low confidence engendered in feedback projections is reduced further by the common representation in models of an outdated knowledge of soil carbon turnover. ‘Model-knowledge integration' — representing in models an advanced understanding of soil carbon stabilization — is the first step to build confidence. This will inform experiments that further increase confidence by resolving competing mechanisms that most influence projected soil-carbon stocks. Improving feedback projections is an imperative for establishing greenhouse gas emission targets that limit climate change.},

abstract = {The net flux of carbon from land use and land-cover change (LULCC) accounted for 12.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010. This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget, not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation, but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore, there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate, and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation, all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered, also, forest management (wood harvest, shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands. Means and standard deviations across the thirteen model estimates of annual emissions for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, are 1.14 +/- 0.23 and 1.12 +/- 0.25 PgC yr(-1) (1 Pg = 1015 g carbon). Four studies also considered the period 2000-2009, and the mean and standard deviations across these four for the three decades are 1.14 +/- 0.39, 1.17 +/- 0.32, and 1.10 +/- 0.11 PgC yr(-1). For the period 1990-2009 the mean global emissions from LULCC are 1.14 +/- 0.18 PgC yr(-1). The standard deviations across model means shown here are smaller than previous estimates of uncertainty as they do not account for the errors that result from data uncertainty and from an incomplete understanding of all the processes affecting the net flux of carbon from LULCC. Although these errors have not been systematically evaluated, based on partial analyses available in the literature and expert opinion, they are estimated to be on the order of +/- 0.5 PgC yr(-1).},

In: Proceedings of the International Symposium and second Chinese National Conference on Rainwater Utilization, Xuzhou-Jiangsu, China, pp. 283-287] for estimating actual evaporation from bare soils was tested under different environmental conditions. Field experiments were carried out on clay soils in a semi-arid region of Turkey. A sandy soil column-experiment in a drying chamber and a study with the same sand media in a greenhouse were conducted at Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University, Japan, in order to test the performance of the model. The model is based on the relations among potential and actual soil evaporation and soil-water potential at the top surface layer of the soil, with some simplifying assumptions. Input parameters of the model are simple and relatively obtainable viz. climatic parameters for the calculations of potential soil evaporation and matric potential measured near the soil surface. Despite some differences between calculated and measured soil evaporation, the agreement was reasonable at all sites. This agreement seems to support the model assumptions, and the model is potentially valuable, but the objective measurement of soil-water potential near the surface of the profile is difficult, especially for a drier upper layer. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Microbial degradation of soil organic matter (SOM) is a key process for terrestrial carbon cycling, although the molecular details of these transformations remain unclear. This study reports the application of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to profile the molecular composition of SOM and its degradation during a simulated warming experiment. A soil sample, collected near Barrow, Alaska, USA, was subjected to a 40-day incubation under anoxic conditions and analyzed before and after the incubation to determine changes of SOM composition. A CHO index based on molecular C, H, and O data was utilized to codify SOM components according to their observed degradation potentials. Compounds with a CHO index score between -1 and 0 in a water-soluble fraction (WSF) demonstrated high degradation potential, with a highest shift of CHO index occurred in the N-containing group of compounds, while similar stoichiometries in a base-soluble fraction (BSF) did not. Additionally, compared with the classical H:C vs O:C van Krevelen diagram, CHO index allowed for direct visualization of the distribution of heteroatoms such as N in the identified SOM compounds. We demonstrate that CHO index is useful not only in characterizing arctic SOM at the molecular level but also enabling quantitative description of SOM degradation, thereby facilitating incorporation of the high resolution MS datasets to future mechanistic models of SOM degradation and prediction of greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of organic soils, including peatlands, in the global carbon cycle, detailed information on regional and global emissions is scarce. This is due to the difficulty to map, measure, and assess the complex dynamics of land, soil, and water interactions needed to assess the human-driven degradation of organic soils. We produced a new methodology for the comprehensive assessment of drained organic soils in agriculture and the estimation of the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Results indicated that over 25 million hectares of organic soils were drained worldwide for agriculture use, of which about 60% were in boreal and temperate cool areas, 34% in tropical areas, and 5% in warm temperate areas. Total emissions from the drainage were globally significant, totaling nearly one billion tonnes CO2eq annually. Of this, the CO2 component, about 780 million tonnes, represented more than one-fourth of total net CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and land use. The bulk of these emissions came from a few tropical countries in Southeast Asia, and was linked to land clearing and drainage for crop cultivation. Geospatial data relative to this work were disseminated via the FAO geospatial server GeoNetwork, while the national aggregated statistics were disseminated via the FAOSTAT database.},

abstract = {The effects of girdling were analysed in a sessile oak (Quercus petraea Matts. Leibl.) forest with an 80-year-old coppice with standard structure in northern Spain. The study evaluated the viability of girdling as an alternative to felling trees during crown thinning. Eighty-four direct competitors of selected future crop trees were girdled by double notching and peeling. Three years after girdling, 100 per cent of the treated trees had died. Approximately half of the girdled trees did not resprout. The occurrence of basal sprouting was very low, and more than 35 per cent of the sprouts had very low vigour. No correlation was found between sprouting and the diameter of the girdled trees or the distance to their nearest neighbour. A negative relationship between the diameter of the girdled tree and the stage of decline was recognized. Girdling is an economic alternative to non-commercial thinning in oak stands and can be seen as an effective structural enrichment treatment. {\textcopyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2007.

It has also been suggested that the accurate specifica- tion of RSOM pools is essential to modelling studies, and that uncertainty in estimates of the size of RSOM pool could be a major source of error in modelling soil organic C. In this paper, current SOM models are re- viewed, and approaches to modelling RSOM and its significance are discussed.

The self-contained introductory presentation is addressed both to those who wish to study the physics of chaotic systems and non-linear dynamics intensively as well as those who are curious to learn more about the fascinating world of chaotic phenomena. Basic concepts like Poincar{\'{e}} section, iterated mappings, Hamiltonian chaos and KAM theory, strange attractors, fractal dimensions, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation theory, self-similarity and renormalisation and transitions to chaos are thoroughly explained. To facilitate comprehension, mathematical concepts and tools are introduced in short sub-sections. The text is supported by numerous computer experiments and a multitude of graphical illustrations and colour plates emphasising the geometrical and topological characteristics of the underlying dynamics. This volume is a completely revised and enlarged second edition which comprises recently obtained research results of topical interest, and has been extended to include a new section on the basic concepts of probability theory. A completely new chapter on fully developed turbulence presents the successes of chaos theory, its limitations as well as future trends in the development of complex spatio-temporal structures.

abstract = {Forest management planning is increasingly focused at the landscape scale. The resulting increase in planning unit size has fueled debate about forest sus- tainability, particularly at local scales. In boreal and temperate regions, Ca depletion in forest and aquatic ecosystems is a recently debated issue. Planning decisions that sustain forest soil and surface water Ca require identification of sites sensitive to Ca loss and application of silvicultural prescriptions that maintain background Ca pools and fluxes. Therefore, I synthesized data on for- est Ca cycling and export and long-term (>10 yr) soil exchangeable Ca pools and changes in surface water quality. Findings indicated that hardwood forest soils contained over three-times more (P < 0.05), their catchments exported three-times more (P < 0.05), and through leaf-litter fall they recycled twice (p < 0.01) as much Ca as conifer–mixedwood forests. Nonetheless, over similar timeframes, forest floor in mature hardwood stands lost more (P < 0.05) Ca than did conifer–mixedwood soils, which was consistent with net stream and lake Ca losses (P < 0.01). However, surface water acid neutralizing capacity increased (P < 0.01), possibly due to greater sulfate declines relative to Ca. On average, based on soil concentrations and contents, forestry practices did not significantly deplete Ca in either cover type. Study results indicate that stand- and catchment-scale forest Ca pools and fluxes can be used to identify areas potentially sensitive to Ca depletion and water quality degradation. However, considerable variation exists in Ca and acidification responses to external stressors, limiting spatial and temporal projections. Abbreviations:},

The Pan American region is home to the majority of commercial bioenergy production and therefore the region offers a broad set of experiences and insights on both conflicts and opportunities for biodiversity and bioenergy. This paper synthesizes lessons learned focusing on experiences in Canada, the United States, and Brazil regarding the conflicts that can arise between bioenergy production and ecological conservation, and benefits that can be derived when bioenergy policies promote planning and more sustainable land-management systems.

abstract = {We used a gap-type forest ecosystem model to study how even- A nd uneven-aged management affected the carbon dynamics and timber production in boreal Norway spruce stands. In business-as-usual management, the intensity of thinnings (from below) and single-tree selective cuttings followed those recommended for even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged management (BSC) in practical forestry in Finland. Moreover, higher or lower basal area thresholds, and shorter or longer production cycles, were used in simulations. We found that, the mean annual carbon uptake, volume growth, and carbon stock in trees and harvested timber, were nearly the same under even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged (BSC) management, when assuming full seed crop in latter one. However, the carbon stock in the soil and ecosystem and the mean annual net ecosystem exchange were slightly smaller under BT. The carbon retention time was longer under BSC. The net present value (NPV with interest rate of 3 per cent) of timber production was clearly lower under BT, when the calculation was initiated at planting on clear-cutting area, in opposite to when initiating calculation a few years before the second thinning. Higher basal area thresholds and longer production cycles increased carbon stocks, carbon retention and timber yield, regardless of management system. On the other hand, the results of uneven-aged management (BSC) were very sensitive to the success of natural regeneration and ingrowth of seedlings, as a reduction of the seed crop by 25-75 per cent from the full seed crop decreases the volume growth by 44-74 per cent and timber yield up to 46 per cent.},

abstract = {Climatic, atmospheric, and land-use changes all have the potential to alter soil microbial activity, mediated by changes in plant inputs. Many microbial models of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition have been proposed recently to advance prediction of climate and carbon (C) feedbacks. Most of these models, however, exhibit unrealistic oscillatory behavior and SOC insensitivity to long-term changes in C inputs. Here we diagnose the source of these problems in four archetypal models and propose a density-dependent formulation of microbial turnover, motivated by community-level interactions, that limits population sizes and reduces oscillations. We compare model predictions to 24 long-term C-input field manipulations and identify key benchmarks. The proposed formulation reproduces soil C responses to long-term C-input changes and implies greater SOC storage associated with CO2-fertilization-driven increases in C inputs over the coming century compared to recent microbial models. This study provides a simple modification to improve microbial models for inclusion in Earth System Models.},

Tropical agriculture, particularly subsistence agriculture is particularly vulnerable, as smallholder farmers do not have adequate resources to adapt to climate change. While agroforestry may play a significant role in mitigating the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHG), it also has a role to play in helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. In this paper, we examine data on the mitigation potential of agroforestry in the humid and sub-humid tropics. We then present the scientific evidence that leads to the expectation that agroforestry also has an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly for small holder farmers.

abstract = {Dietary constraints for large herbivores tend to be most strongly linked to quality of the forage available. In highly seasonal environments, such as mountain areas, both plant quality and available biomass may act as constraints. However, studies addressing the nutritional basis of diet selection of wild large herbivores under harsh conditions in sufficiently large spatial and temporal frameworks are scarce. We studied the functional importance of relative variability in plant quality and biomass for diet selection by a migratory population of Alpine red deer (Cervus elaphus) at the landscape scale and across an annual cycle. Botanical diet composition at plant group level did not show a particular 'Alpine pattern' but was similar to known patterns from lowland areas. Sources of variability were season, habitat (either open land or forest) and sex. Red deer foraged selectively in all seasons, and preferences for plant groups were negatively linked to plant abundances. Use and selection of plant groups were associated with high nutritional value (high crude protein and organic matter, low fibre), but partly also with high levels of active tannins. In the cold season, deer made strong nocturnal use of fertilized valley floor meadows offering high-quality grass, but still showed some selection for tannin- and fibre-rich coniferous browse, indicating a need for supplementing grass intake. Altogether, the nutritional value of the diet exceeded that of the forage available in the forested habitat, which was at or below the lower threshold for fulfilling metabolic needs of red deer. High-quality grass on farmed meadows may thus be a critical source of food in mountainous areas during winter. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Conceptual models suggest that stability of organic carbon (OC) in soil depends on the source of plant litter, occlusion within aggregates, incorporation in organomineral complexes, and location within the soil profile. Density fractionation is a useful tool to study the relevance of OC stabilization in aggregates and in association with minerals, but it has rarely been applied to full soil profiles. We aim to determine factors shaping the depth profiles of physically unprotected and mineral associated OC and test their relevance for OC stability across a range of European soils that vary in vegetation, soil types, parent material, and land use. At each of the 12 study sites, 10 soil cores were sampled to 60 cm depth and subjected to density separation. Bulk soil samples and density fractions (free light fractions - fLF, occluded light fractions - oLF, heavy fractions - HF) were analysed for OC, total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13, and Delta C-14. Bulk samples were also incubated to determine CO2 evolution per g OC in the samples (specific mineralization rates) as an indicator for OC stability. Depth profiles of OC in the light fraction (LF-OC) matched those of roots for undisturbed grassland and forest sites, suggesting that roots are shaping the depth distribution of LF-OC. Organic C in the HF declined less with soil depth than LF-OC and roots, especially at grassland sites. The decrease in Delta C-14 (increase in age) of HF-OC with soil depth was related to soil pH as well as to dissolved OC fluxes. This indicates that dissolved OC translocation contributes to the formation of subsoil HF-OC and shapes the Delta C-14 profiles. The LF at three sites were rather depleted in C-14, indicating the presence of fossil material such as coal and lignite, probably inherited from the parent material. At the other sites, modern Delta C-14 signatures and positive correlations between specific mineralization rates and fLF-OC indicate the fLF is a potentially available energy and nutrient source for subsurface microorganisms throughout the profile. Declining specific mineralization rates with soil depth confirm greater stability of OC in subsoils across sites. The overall importance of OC stabilization by binding to minerals was demonstrated by declining specific mineralization rates with increasing contributions of HF-OC to bulk soil OC, and the low Delta C-14 values of HF-OC. The stability of HF-OC was greater in subsoils than in topsoils; nevertheless, a portion of HF-OC was active throughout the profile. While quantitatively less important than OC in the HF, consistent older ages of oLF-OC than fLF-OC suggest that occlusion of LF-OC in aggregates also contributes to OC stability in subsoils. Overall, our results indicate that association of OC in soils, irrespective of vegetation, soil type, and land use.},

abstract = {In agricultural soils, the formation of soil organic matter largely depends on the carbon (C) input by crop residues and rhizodeposition, which is thus of decisive importance for the management and prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in cropland and grassland. However, there is a remarkable lack of reliable, crop-specific C input data. We used a plant C allocation approach to estimate the C input of major crops and grassland into agricultural soils of Bavaria in southeast Germany. Historic and recent plant C allocation coefficients were estimated and C inputs were calculated for a 60-year period (1951-2010) using long-term agricultural statistics. The spatial distribution of C inputs within Bavaria was derived from county-specific statistical data. The results revealed increases of the C input by 107-139% for cereals, 173-188% for root, forage and leguminous crops and 34% for grassland in the last 60 years. This increase was related to linear yield increases until 1995 despite significant changes of plant C allocation. However, from 1995 onwards, crop yields and related C inputs stagnated, which allowed a robust estimation of recent crop-specific C input values. A total C input of 3.8-6.7tha-1yr-1was estimated for cereals, 5.2-6.3tha-1yr-1for root, forage and leguminous crops and 2.4tha-1yr-1for grassland. These amounts were partly higher compared to estimations in the literature. A generally high spatial variability of C inputs was detected within Bavaria with differences of up to 40% between adjacent counties. The results of this study could be used to optimize the C input of crop rotations and thus promote the formation of soil organic matter and C sequestration in agricultural soils on the basis of a soil carbon model. Moreover, recent estimations of C inputs could be used to model the future development of agricultural SOC stocks. A further stagnation of crop yields and the related C input under an ongoing temperature increase bears the risk of a future decrease of SOC stocks in cropland soils of Bavaria. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stumps are the largest coarse woody debris component in managed forests, but their role in nutrient cycling is poorly understood. We studied carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and silver birch (Betula pendula) stumps, which had decomposed for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 years after clear-cutting in southern Finland. Carbon and N were released significantly faster from birch stumps than from conifer stumps. In 40 years, conifer stumps lost 78% and birch stumps 90% of their initial C. In contrast, the amount of N in stumps increased, indicating that external N accumulated in the stumps. After 40 years of decomposition, the amount of N was 1.7 and 2.7 times higher than the initial amount in pine and spruce stumps, respectively. Nitrogen was released from birch stumps, but only after they had decomposed for 20 or more years. On average, 59% of N stored in birch stumps was released during 40 years. The results indicate that the stumps of the major tree species in Fennoscandian forests are long-term C and, especially, N pools which serve as N sinks, thus potentially diminishing N leaching into ground water and watercourses after harvesting. This suggests that the removal of stumps for bioenergy production may markedly affect the nutrient status and nutrient cycling of boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {We present a new model system, which facilitates scaling of ecosystem processes from the site to regional simulation domains. The new framework LandscapeDNDC—partly based on the biogeochemical site scale model DNDC—inherits a series of new features with regard to process descriptions, model structure and data I/O functionality. LandscapeDNDC incorporates different vegetation types and management systems for simulating carbon, nitrogen and water related biosphere–atmosphere–hydrosphere fluxes in forest, arable and grassland ecosystems and allows the dynamic simulation of land use changes. The modeling concept divides ecosystems into six substates (canopy air chemistry, microclimate, physiology, water cycle, vegetation structure, and soil biogeochemistry) and provides alternative modules dealing with these substates. The model can be applied on the site scale, as well as for three-dimensional regional simulations. For regional applications LandscapeDNDC integrates all grid cells synchronously forward in time. This allows easy coupling to other spatially distributed models (e.g. for hydrology or atmospheric chemistry) and efficient two-way exchange of states. This paper describes the fundamental design concept of the model and its object-oriented software implementation. Two example applications are presented. First, calculation of a nitrous oxide emission inventory from agricultural soils for the State of Saxaony (Germany), including data preprocessing of the regional model input data. The computational effort for the LandscapeDNDC preprocessing and simulation could be speed up by a factor of almost 100 compared to the approach using the original DNDC version 9.3. Calculated N2O emissions for Saxony with LandscapeDNDC (2693 t N2O–N/a) were compared with the original DNDC model (2725 t N2O–N/a), the IPCC Tier I methodology (1107 t N2O–N/a), and the German National Inventory Report (equal to IPCC Tier II, 2100 t N2O–N/a). The second example illustrates the capabilities of LandscapeDNDC for building a fully coupled three-dimensional model system on the landscape scale. Therefore we coupled the biogeochemical and plant growth calculations to a hydrological transport model and demonstrate the transport of nitrogen along a virtual hillslope and associated formation of indirect nitrous oxide emissions.},

Landsat imagery with 30 m resolution was adjusted by contemporaneous Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to calibrate the model based on previous CASA research. Results showed annual NPP predictions of between 300 - 450 grams C per square meter for coastal rangeland sites. Irrigation increased the predicted NPP carbon flux of grazed lands by 59 grams C per square meter annually compared to unmanaged grasslands. Low intensity grazing activity appeared to promote higher grass regrowth until June, compared to the ungrazed grassland sites. These modeling methods were shown to be successful in capturing the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland forage production across the area of individual ranch properties.},

abstract = {Sole-carbon-source tests (Biolog), designed to identify bacteria, have become very popular for metabolically fingerprinting soil microbial communities, despite disadvantages associated with the use of carbon source profiles that primarily select for fast-growing bacteria. In this paper we describe the use of an alternative method that combines the advantages of the Biolog community-level physiological profile (CLPP) method, in which microtiter-based detection plates are used, with the ability to measure carbon dioxide evolution from whole soil. This method facilitates measurement over short periods of time (4 to 6 h) and does not require the extraction and culturing of organisms. Deep-well microtiter plates are used as test wells into which soil is placed. The apparatus to fill the deep-well plates and interface it with a second removable detection plate is described. Two detection systems, a simple colorimetric reaction in absorbent alkali and scintillation counting with radioactive carbon sources, are described. The methods were compared to the Biolog-CLPP system by using soils under different vegetation types and soil treated with wastewater sludge. We aimed to test the hypothesis that using whole soil would have specific advantages over using extracts in that more immediate responses to substrates could be obtained that would reflect activity rather than growth. The whole-soil method was more rapid and gave earlier detection of C source use. Also, the metabolic fingerprints obtained could discriminate between sludge treatments.},

abstract = {Climate change with increasing periods of drought is expected to reduce the yield of biomass crops such as poplars. To combat yield loss, it is important to better understand the molecular mechanisms that control growth under drought. Here, the goal was to resolve the drought-induced changes of active cytokinins, a main growth hormone in plants, at the tissue level in different cell types and organs of poplars (Populus × canescens) in comparison with growth, biomass, leaf shedding, photosynthesis and water potential. Since cytokinin response is mediated by type-A response regulators, ARR5::GUS reporter lines were used to map cytokinin activity histochemically. The expression of PtaRR3 and PtaRR10 was examined in different stem sections. Young leaves showed strong cytokinin activity in the veins and low staining under drought stress, accompanied by diminished leaf expansion. Leaf scars, at positions where drought-shedding occurred, showed strong reduction of cytokinin activity. The pith in the differentiation zone of stem showed high cytokinin activity with distinct, very active parenchymatic cells and enhanced activity close to primary xylem. This pattern was maintained under drought but the cytokinin activity was reduced. Mature phloem parenchymatic cells showed high cytokinin activity and mature wood showed no detectable cytokinin activity. Cytokinin activity in the cambium was apparent as a clear ring, which faded under drought. Xylem-localized cytokinin activities were also mirrored by the relative expression of PtaRR3, whereas PtaRR10 showed developmental but no drought-induced changes. Primary meristems exhibited high cytokinin activity regardless of drought stress, supporting a function of this phytohormone in meristem maintenance, whereas declining cytokinin activities in apical pith tissues and cambium of drought-stressed poplars linked cytokinin in these cell types with the control of primary and secondary growth processes. Changes in cytokinin activity further imply a role in drought avoidance mechanisms of poplars, especially in the reduction of leaf area.},

abstract = {Models are important for predicting how soil organic carbon alters with changing environment and management. We tested three different ways of parameterizing the Rothamsted Carbon Model in four treatments from the long-term static fertilization experiment at Bad Lauchst{\"{a}}dt. Four bare fallow plots were also used to test different ways of parameterizing the model. Model version 1 used $\Delta$14C to estimate the amount of inert organic matter whereas in versions 2 and 3 a long-term bare fallow treatment was used to estimate this amount. In version 1, C inputs were optimized from the long-term data. In version 2, crop inputs were estimated from published functions that relate C inputs to crop yields. In version 3, C inputs (average or minimum data) were taken from actual measurements of crop and root residues. In both versions 2 and 3, rhizodeposition was included as additional input of 50% (winter wheat, spring barley) or 35% (potatoes, sugar beet) of the C input by crop and root residues. The performance of the three versions decreased in the order 3 > 2 ≫ 1. Model efficiency and root mean square error were 0.86 and 6.1 for version 3 and 0.81 and 7.0 for version 2. Overall, our results indicate the need for a long-term treatment for calibration. Setting total C inputs as a function of crop yield performed satisfactorily. Measurements of crop and root residues gave a good representation of total C inputs when carbon from rhizodeposition was included as additional input. {\textcopyright} 2007 British Society of Soil Science.},

abstract = {Amending soil with biochar (pyrolized biomass) is suggested as a globally applicable approach to address climate change and soil degradation by carbon sequestration, reducing soil-borne greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing soil nutrient retention. Biochar was shown to promote plant growth, especially when combined with nutrient-rich organic matter, e.g., co-composted biochar. Plant growth promotion was explained by slow release of nutrients, although a mechanistic understanding of nutrient storage in biochar is missing. Here we identify a complex, nutrient-rich organic coating on co-composted biochar that covers the outer and inner (pore) surfaces of biochar particles using high-resolution spectro(micro)scopy and mass spectrometry. Fast field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance, electrochemical analysis and gas adsorption demonstrated that this coating adds hydrophilicity, redox-active moieties, and additional mesoporosity, which strengthens biochar-water interactions and thus enhances nutrient retention. This implies that the functioning of biochar in soil is determined by the formation of an organic coating, rather than biochar surface oxidation, as previously suggested.},

abstract = {Established theory addresses the idea that herbivory can have positive feedbacks on nutrient flow to plants. Positive feedbacks likely emerge from a greater availability of organic carbon that primes the soil by supporting nutrient turnover through consumer and especially microbially-mediated metabolism in the detrital pool. We developed an entirely novel stoichiometric model that demonstrates the mechanism of a positive feedback. In particular, we show that sloppy or partial feeding by herbivores increases detrital carbon and nitrogen allowing for greater nitrogen mineralization and nutritive feedback to plants. The model consists of differential equations coupling flows among pools of: plants, herbivores, detrital carbon and nitrogen, and inorganic nitrogen. We test the effects of different levels of herbivore grazing completion and of the stoichiometric quality (carbon to nitrogen ratio, C:N) of the host plant. Our model analyses show that partial feeding and plant C:N interact because when herbivores are sloppy and plant biomass is diverted to the detrital pool, more mineral nitrogen is available to plants because of the stoichiometric difference between the organisms in the detrital pool and the herbivore. This model helps to identify how herbivory may feedback positively on primary production, and it mechanistically connects direct and indirect feedbacks from soil to plant production.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Conversion of tropical peatlands to agriculture leads to a release of carbon from previously stable, long-term storage, resulting in land subsidence that can be a surrogate measure of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere. We present an analysis of recent large-scale subsidence monitoring studies in <i>Acacia</i> and oil palm plantations on peatland in SE Asia, and compare the findings with previous studies. Subsidence in the first 5 yr after drainage was found to be 142 cm, of which 75 cm occurred in the first year. After 5 yr, the subsidence rate in both plantation types, at average water table depths of 0.7 m, remained constant at around 5 cm yr<sup>−1</sup>. The results confirm that primary consolidation contributed substantially to total subsidence only in the first year after drainage, that secondary consolidation was negligible, and that the amount of compaction was also much reduced within 5 yr. Over 5 yr after drainage, 75 % of cumulative subsidence was caused by peat oxidation, and after 18 yr this was 92 %. The average rate of carbon loss over the first 5 yr was 178 <i>t</i> CO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, which reduced to 73 <i>t</i> CO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> over subsequent years, potentially resulting in an average loss of 100 <i>t</i> CO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> over 25 yr. Part of the observed range in subsidence and carbon loss values is explained by differences in water table depth, but vegetation cover and other factors such as addition of fertilizers also influence peat oxidation. A relationship with groundwater table depth shows that subsidence and carbon loss are still considerable even at the highest water levels theoretically possible in plantations. This implies that improved plantation water management will reduce these impacts by 20 % at most, relative to current conditions, and that high rates of carbon loss and land subsidence are inevitable consequences of conversion of forested tropical peatlands to other land uses.</p>},

abstract = {Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) additions to soils can have large impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling. As the soil microbial community drives SOC fluxes, understanding how PyOM additions affect soil microbes is essential to understanding how PyOM affects SOC. We studied SOC dynamics and surveyed soil bacterial communities after OM additions in a field experiment. We produced and mixed in either 350[thinsp][deg]C corn stover PyOM or an equivalent initial amount of dried corn stover to a Typic Fragiudept soil. Stover increased SOC-derived and total CO2 fluxes (up to 6x), and caused rapid and persistent changes in bacterial community composition over 82 days. In contrast, PyOM only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes (up to 2x) and caused fewer changes in bacterial community composition. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that increased in response to PyOM additions, 70% also responded to stover additions. These OTUs likely thrive on easily mineralizable carbon (C) that is found both in stover and, to a lesser extent, in PyOM. In contrast, we also identified unique PyOM responders, which may respond to substrates such as polyaromatic C. In particular, members of Gemmatimonadetes tended to increase in relative abundance in response to PyOM but not to fresh organic matter. We identify taxa to target for future investigations of the mechanistic underpinnings of ecological phenomena associated with PyOM additions to soil.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine effects of hip and ankle stretching on gait function of older people.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

SETTING: Flexibility training was performed in participants' homes. Assessments were performed in a biomechanics laboratory.

PARTICIPANTS: Forty healthy volunteers (mean age +/- SD, 72.1+/-4.7 y) randomized to 2 groups: intervention (n=20) and control (n=20).

INTERVENTION: Intervention participants performed an 8-week stretching program, and control group participants maintained activity level for 8 weeks. One investigator made weekly visits to instruct and monitor participants.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were passive joint motion for hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion and freely chosen gait speed. Secondary outcome measures were gait parameters during freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed walking (stride length, joint displacement).

RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group had increased combined hip and knee motion (P=.023), ankle motion (P=.020), and freely chosen gait speed (P=.016). The intervention group showed statistically nonsignificant trends of increased stride length at freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed.

CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest joint motion is a modifiable impairment that is effectively targeted with flexibility training for older people. Participants in the intervention group had improvements in joint motion as well as increased freely chosen gait speed. Mechanisms responsible for changes in freely chosen gait speed warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, the loss of forests now contributes almost 20% of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. There is an immediate need to reduce the current rates of forest loss, and the associated release of carbon dioxide, but for many areas of the world these rates are largely unknown. The Soviet Union contained a substantial part of the world's forests and the fate of those forests and their effect on carbon dynamics remain unknown for many areas of the former Eastern Bloc. For Georgia, the political and economic transitions following independence in 1991 have been dramatic. In this paper we quantify rates of land use changes and their effect on the terrestrial carbon budget for Georgia. A carbon book-keeping model traces changes in carbon stocks using historical and current rates of land use change. Landsat satellite images acquired circa 1990 and 2000 were analyzed to detect changes in forest cover since 1990.\n\nRESULTS: The remote sensing analysis showed that a modest forest loss occurred, with approximately 0.8% of the forest cover having disappeared after 1990. Nevertheless, growth of Georgian forests still contribute a current national sink of about 0.3 Tg of carbon per year, which corresponds to 31% of the country anthropogenic carbon emissions.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We assume that the observed forest loss is mainly a result of illegal logging, but we have not found any evidence of large-scale clear-cutting. Instead local harvesting of timber for household use is likely to be the underlying driver of the observed logging. The Georgian forests are a currently a carbon sink and will remain as such until about 2040 if the current rate of deforestation persists. Forest protection efforts, combined with economic growth, are essential for reducing the rate of deforestation and protecting the carbon sink provided by Georgian forests.},

abstract = {Throughout the Holocene, northern peatlands have both accumulated carbon and emitted methane. Their impact on climate radiative forcing has been the net of cooling (persistent CO2 uptake) and warming (persistent CH4 emission). We evaluated this by developing very simple Holocene peatland carbon flux trajectories, and using these as inputs to a simple atmospheric perturbation model. Flux trajectories are based on estimates of contemporary CH4 flux (15-50 TgCH4 yr1), total accumulated peat C (250- 450 Pg C), and peatland initiation dates. The contemporary perturbations to the atmosphere due to northern peatlands are an increase of 100 ppbv CH4 and a decrease of 35 ppmv CO2. The net radiative forcing impact northern peatlands is currently about 0.2 to 0.5Wm2 (a cooling). It is likely that peatlands initially caused a net warming of up to 10.1Wm2, but have been causing an increasing net cooling for the past 8000- 11 000 years. A series of sensitivity simulations indicate that the current radiative forcing impact is determined primarily by the magnitude of the contemporary methane flux and the magnitude of the total C accumulated as peat, and that radiative forcing dynamics during the Holocene depended on flux trajectory, but the overall pattern was similar in all cases},

abstract = {The area of dedicated energy crops is expected to increase in Sweden. This will result in direct land use changes, which may affect the carbon stocks in soil and biomass, as well as yield levels and the use of inputs. Carbon dioxide (CO2) ﬂuxes of biomass are often not considered when calculating the climate impact in life cycle assess- ments (LCA) assuming that the CO2 released at combustion has recently been captured by the biomass in ques- tion. With the extended time lag between capture and release of CO2 inherent in many perennial bioenergy systems, the relation between carbon neutrality and climate neutrality may be questioned. In this paper, previ- ously published methodologies and models are combined in a methodological framework that can assist LCA practitioners in interpreting the time-dependent climate impact of a bioenergy system. The treatment of carbon differs from conventional LCA practice in that no distinction is made between fossil and biogenic carbon. A time-dependent indicator is used to enable a representation of the climate impact that is not dependent on the choice of a speciﬁc characterization time horizon or time of evaluation and that does not use characterization factors, such as global warming potential and global temperature potential. The indicator used to aid in the interpretation phase of this paper is global mean surface temperature change (DTs(n)). A theoretical system pro- ducing willow for district heating was used to study land use change effects depending on previous land use and variations in the standing biomass carbon stocks. When replacing annual crops with willow this system presented a cooling contribution to DTs(n). However, the ﬁrst years after establishing the willow plantation it presented a warming contribution to DTs(n). This behavior was due mainly to soil organic carbon (SOC) variation. A rapid initial increase in standing biomass counteracted the initial SOC loss.},

abstract = {Swedish forestry has successfully developed systems for sustained yield production of wood. Silvicultural techniques are today completely dominated (96%) by clear-felling methods. By contrast, Swedish natural forests and preindustrial cultural woodlands were ecologically and culturally diverse, with a substantial proportion having a continuous tree cover as a response to natural disturbance dynamics and preindustrial agricultural land management. If forest management systems do not mimic this diversity of disturbance regimes sufficiently well, the scope of sustainable forest management to include biodiversity and sociocultural values will not be met. This study estimated the past and present amount of one cultural and two natural disturbance regimes known to deliver continuous tree cover in two study areas located around two important biophysical and sociocultural transition zones in northern and southern Sweden, respectively. Several approaches were used to estimate the amount of remaining continuous tree cover forests. The results indicate that 9-10% of the study areas is made up by site types that historically would have held a large proportion of continuous tree cover forests. Estimates for productive site types show that only 1-2% of these sites remain in southern Sweden and 10-20% in northern Sweden. The data indicate that present management in both study areas is similar. Thus, these differences between the regions will disappear in a few decades. To achieve the aim of Swedish forest and environmental policies there is a clear need to develop and use alternative forest management methods on appropriate sites. {\textcopyright} 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on the stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) remains a major source of uncertainty in predicting future changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. One unsettled issue is whether the mineralization response to temperature depends on SOC mineralization rate. Long-term (>25 years) bare fallow experiments (LTBF) in which the soil is kept free of any vegetation and organic inputs, and their associated archives of soil samples represent a unique research platform to examine this issue as with increasing duration of fallow, the lability of remaining total SOC decreases. We retrieved soils from LTBF experiments situated at Askov (Denmark), Grignon (France), Ultuna (Sweden) and Versailles (France) and sampled at the start of the experiments and after 25, 50, 52, and 79 years of bare fallow, respectively. Soils were incubated at 4, 12, 20 and 35 °C and the evolved CO2 monitored. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of SOC was then calculated for similar loss of CO2 at the different temperatures. The Ea was always higher for samples taken at the end of the bare-fallow period, implying a higher temperature sensitivity of stable C than of labile C. Our results provide strong evidence for a general relationship between temperature sensitivity and SOC stability upon which significant improvements in predictive models could be based.

abstract = {Forests play a key role in the carbon cycle as they store huge quantities of organic carbon, most of which is stored in soils, with a smaller part being held in vegetation. While the carbon storage capacity of forests is influenced by forestry, the long-term impacts of forest managers' decisions on soil organic carbon (SOC) remain unclear. Using a meta-analysis approach, we showed that conventional biomass harvests preserved the SOC of forests, unlike intensive harvests where logging residues were harvested to produce fuelwood. Conventional harvests caused a decrease in carbon storage in the forest floor, but when the whole soil profile was taken into account, we found that this loss in the forest floor was compensated by an accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers. Conversely, we found that intensive harvests led to SOC losses in all layers of forest soils. We assessed the potential impact of intensive harvests on the carbon budget, focusing on managed European forests. Estimated carbon losses from forest soils suggested that intensive biomass harvests could constitute an important source of carbon transfer from forests to the atmosphere (142-497 Tg-C), partly neutralizing the role of a carbon sink played by forest soils.},

abstract = {Excessive N fertilization results in low N-use efficiency (NUE) without any yield benefits and can have profound, long-term environmental consequences including soil acidification, N leaching and increased production of greenhouse gases. Improving NUE in crop production has been a longstanding, worldwide challenge. A crucial strategy to improve NUE is to en- hance N uptake by roots. Taking maize as a model crop, we have compared root dry weight (RDW), root/shoot biomass ratio (R/S), and NUE of maize grown in the field in China and in western countries using data from 106 studies published since 1959. Detailed analysis re- vealed that the differences in theRDWand R/S of maize at silking in China and the western countries were not derived from variations in climate, geography, and stress factors. In- stead, NUE was positively correlated with R/S andRDW; R/S and NUE of maize varieties grown in western countries were significantly greater than those grown in China. Wethen testified this conclusion by conducting field trials with representative maize hybrids in China (ZD958 and XY335) and the US (P32D79). We found that US P32D79 had a better root ar- chitecture for increased N uptake and removed more mineral N than Chinese cultivars from the 0-60 cm soil profile. Reported data and our field results demonstrate that a large and deep root, with an appropriate architecture and higher stress tolerance (higher plant density, drought and N deficiency), underlies high NUE in maize production. Werecommend breed- ing for these traits to reduce the N-fertilizer use and thus N-leaching in maize production and paying more attention to increase tolerance to stresses in China.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter is a vast store of carbon, with a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Despite its importance, the dynamics of soil organic carbon decomposition, under the impact of climate change or changing litter inputs, are poorly understood. Current biogeochemical models usually lack microbial processes and thus miss an important feedback when considering the fate of carbon. Here we use a series of modelling experiments to evaluate two different model structures: one with a standard first-order kinetic representation of soil decomposition (DecoChem v1.0, hereafter chemical model) and one with control of soil decomposition through microbial activity (DecoBio v1.0, hereafter biological model). The biological model includes cycling of organic matter into and out of microbial biomass, and simulates the decay rate as a functional of microbial activity. We tested two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized different responses in the two models to increased litter inputs and glucose additions. In the microbial model we hypothesized that this perturbation would prime microbial activity and reduce soil carbon stocks; in the chemical model we expected this perturbation to increase C stocks. In the biological model, responses to changed litter quantity were more rapid, but with the residence time of soil C altering such that soil C stocks were buffered. However, in the biological model there was a strong response to increased glucose additions (i.e. changes in litter quality), with significant losses to soil C stocks over time, driven by priming. Secondly, we hypothesized that warming will stimulate decomposition in the chemical model and loss of C, but in the biological model soil C will be less sensitive to warming, due to complex microbial feedbacks. The numerical experiments supported this hypothesis, with the chemical model soil C residence times and steady-state C stocks adjusting strongly with temperature changes, extending over decades. On the other hand, the biological model showed a rapid response to temperature that subsided after a few years, with total soil C stocks largely unchanged. The microbial model shows qualitative agreement with experimental warming studies that found transient increases in soil respiration that decline within a few years. In conclusion, the biological model is largely buffered against bulk changes in litter inputs and climate, unlike the chemical model, while the biological model displays a strong priming response to additions of labile litter. Our results have therefore highlighted significantly different sensitivities between chemical and biological modelling approaches for soil decomposition.},

abstract = {Temperate forests of North America are thought to be significant sinks of atmospheric CO2. We developed a below-ground carbon (C) budget for well-drained soils in Harvard Forest Massachusetts, an ecosystem that is storing C. Measurements of carbon and radiocarbon (14C) inventory were used to determine the turnover time and maximum rate of CO2 production from heterotrophic respiration of three fractions of soil organic matter (SOM): recognizable litter fragments (L), humified low density material (H), and high density or mineral-associated organic matter (M). Turnover times in all fractions increased with soil depth and were 2–5 years for recognizable leaf litter, 5–10 years for root litter, 40–100+ years for low density humified material and >100 years for carbon associated with minerals. These turnover times represent the time carbon resides in the plant + soil system, and may underestimate actual decomposition rates if carbon resides for several years in living root, plant or woody material. Soil respiration was partitioned into two components using 14C: recent photosynthate which is metabolized by roots and microorganisms within a year of initial fixation (Recent- C), and C that is respired during microbial decomposition of SOM that resides in the soil for several years or longer (Reservoir-C). For the whole soil, we calculate that decomposition of Reservoir-C contributes approximately 41% of the total annual soil respiration. Of this 41%, recognizable leaf or root detritus accounts for 80% of the flux, and 20% is from the more humified fractions that dominate the soil carbon stocks. Measurements of CO2 and 14CO2 in the soil atmosphere and in total soil respiration were combined with surface CO2 fluxes and a soil gas diffusion model to determine the flux and isotopic signature of C produced as a function of soil depth. 63% of soil respiration takes place in the top 15 cm of the soil (O + A + Ap horizons). The average residence time of Reservoir-C in the plant + soil system is 8±1 years and the average age of carbon in total soil respiration (Recent-C + Reservoir-C) is 4±1 years. TheOandAhorizons have accumulated 4.4 kgCm--2 above the plowlayer since abandon- ment by settlers in the late-1800's. C pools contributing the most to soil respiration have short enough turnover times that they are likely in steady state. However, most C is stored as humified organic matter within both the O and A horizons and has turnover times from 40 to 100+ years respectively. These reservoirs continue to accumulate carbon at a combined rate of 10–30 gC m--2 yr--1. This rate of accumulation is only 5–15% of the total ecosystem C sink measured in this stand using eddy covariance methods.},

abstract = {The effects of clear-cutting (CC) and clear-cutting followed by prescribed burning (CC-B) on humus chemical and microbiological variables and quality were compared in a Norway spruce dominated stand in North-Eastern Finland. The pattern of chemical changes in humus was similar after both treatments but CC-B caused greater changes than CC. Treatments raised the pH, cation exchange capacity and base saturation compared to an untreated standing forest control (Ctr). Total microbial carbon (Cmic) measured by substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and fumigation-extraction (FE) methods decreased following treatments. CC caused a 21% reduction of Cmic compared to Ctr (10,890 $\mu$g g−1 dry wt), as measured by SIR, and a 27% reduction compared to Ctr (7281 $\mu$g g−1 dry wt) as measured by FE. CC-B resulted in 53 and 67% lower Cmic than Ctr as measured by SIR and FE, respectively. Reasons for this decline in Cmic are proposed. Fungal biomass determined as humus ergosterol concentration fell even more steeply than total Cmic. Humus quality was analysed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIR) which revealed differences in humus structure between treatments. The NIR data could be interpreted to explain 75–82% of the variation in Cmic-FE, Cmic-SIR and ergosterol concentration. CC and CC-B lowered soil basal respiration, but not proportionally with the reduction in Cmic since the specific respiration rate (CO2-C evolved per unit Cmic) was clearly higher with CC-B than CC or Ctr. CC and CC-B both resulted in a higher concentration of NH4+ but only the humus from CC-B showed nitrification during a 6 week laboratory incubation.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The role of organo-mineral interactions, microbial dynamics, and vertical plant input profiles are hy-pothesized to be important in controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we enhanced and applied a model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of SOM e BAMS1) that rep-resents microbial dynamics and organo-mineral interactions integrated with a multiphase reactive transport solver for variably saturated porous media. The model represents aqueous chemistry, aqueous advection and diffusion, gaseous diffusion, sorption processes, bacterial and fungal activity, and arche-typal monomer-and polymer-carbon substrate groups, including dead cell wall material. This model structure is fundamentally different, and produces different SOM dynamics, than the pseudo-first order relationships that are used in most site-and global-scale terrestrial SOM models. We simulated two grasslands, a seven-site chronosequence ($\sim$3.9e240 Ky) in Northern California, and a Russian Chernozem site where soils were sampled 100 years apart. We calibrated the model's vertically-resolved soil bulk specific surface area (SBSSA) using observed bulk SOM content, and then tested the model against observed D 14 C profiles. The modeled microbial processes, organo-mineral interactions, and vertical aqueous transport produced realistic vertically-resolved predictions of bulk SOM content, D 14 C values of SOM, lignin content, and fungi-to-aerobic bacteria biomass ratios. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that vertical carbon input profiles were important controls over the D 14 C depth distribution. Shallower carbon input profiles lead to older carbon at depth. In addition, the SBSSA was the dominant control over the magnitude and vertical distribution of SOM stocks. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating microbial activity, sorption, and vertical transport into land models to predict SOM dynamics.},

abstract = {With increasing urbanization and agricultural expansion, large tracts of wetlands have been either disturbed or converted to other uses. To protect wetlands, accurate distribution maps are needed. However, because of the dramatic diversity of wetlands and difficulties in field work, wetland mapping on a large spatial scale is very difficult to do. Until recently there were only a few high resolution global wetland distribution datasets developed for wetland protection and restoration. In this paper, we used hydrologic and climatic variables in combination with Compound Topographic Index (CTI) data in modeling the average annual water table depth at 30 arc-second grids over the continental areas of the world except for Antarctica. The water table depth data were modeled without considering influences of anthropogenic activities. We adopted a relationship between potential wetland distribution and water table depth to develop the global wetland suitability distribution dataset. The modeling results showed that the total area of global wetland reached 3.316x10(7) km(2). Remote-sensing-based validation based on a compilation of wetland areas from multiple sources indicates that the overall accuracy of our product is 83.7%. This result can be used as the basis for mapping the actual global wetland distribution. Because the modeling process did not account for the impact of anthropogenic water management such as irrigation and reservoir construction over suitable wetland areas, our result represents the upper bound of wetland areas when compared with some other global wetland datasets. Our method requires relatively fewer datasets and has a higher accuracy than a recently developed global wetland dataset.},

abstract = {Soil microbes favour easily decomposable organic compounds, and, consequently, soil organic matter tends to enrich with recalcitrant carbon compounds. In theory, this leads to an increasing temperature sensitivity of decomposition towards older fractions of soil organic matter. We tested this theory in a Sphagnum peat profile. This profile was particularly suitable for this purpose because the age of organic matter increased with depth. The age correlated closely with the degree of decomposition in the oxic layer and soil minerals did not interfere with the relationship between the age and the temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We sampled and analysed the peat profile by layer. We took laboratory measurements of chemical characteristics, decomposability and temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We used the bomb-14C isotopic tracer to differentiate the sources of respired CO2 into age-classes and to estimate the temperature sensitivity of the oldest fraction in each layer. We also used the natural abundance ratio of stable carbon isotopes as an indicator of the recalcitrance of the decomposing carbon fraction. The measurements showed that the decomposition of the older and more recalcitrant carbon compounds was enhanced more in response to increasing temperature than was the decomposition of the younger and more labile compounds. Our results support the theory tested and indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition increases with depth, age and recalcitrance in the oxic layer of the studied peat profile. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Peat-forming organic soils lose large amounts of carbon and soil volume when drained. Although surface subsidence is often taken as a proxy for the associated carbon loss, other mechanisms also cause a change in volume. To infer the reliability of subsidence for estimating carbon loss, we compared long-term subsidence rates of an 80 ha area of temperate fen that was drained 140 yr ago against estimates of subsidence based on soil bulk densities measured at four sites. Both methods correlate significantly, yield similar subsidence rates of 0.8--1.6 cm/yr and underpin the value of using profile information for inferring volumetric loss. Peat oxidation accounts for 28--64% of the loss in volume, which is equivalent to annual carbon loss rates of 2.5--5.5 t C/ha. Whereas the profile-based method is also suitable for estimating carbon loss, the wide range of oxidative contribution to the overall subsidence indicates that subsidence alone cannot provide an unbiased estimate of carbon emission factors from drained fens.},

abstract = {Global nitrogen fixation contributes 413 Tg of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually of which anthropogenic activities are responsible for half, 210 Tg N. The majority of the transformations of anthropogenic Nr are on land (240 Tg N yr(-1)) within soils and vegetation where reduced Nr contributes most of the input through the use of fertilizer nitrogen in agriculture. Leakages from the use of fertilizer Nr contribute to nitrate (NO3(-)) in drainage waters from agricultural land and emissions of trace Nr compounds to the atmosphere. Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH3) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), contribute 100 Tg N yr(-1) to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4. Leaching and riverine transport of NO3 contribute 40-70 Tg N yr(-1) to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 Tg N yr(-1)) to double the ocean processing of Nr. Some of the marine Nr is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N2 or N2O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of Nr in the atmosphere, with the exception of N2O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 10(2)-10(3) years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of Nr is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N2O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of Nr from which it is produced.},

The intensity of the underlying processes differs locally with respect to land management practices as well as hydro-geomorphic setting and soil conditions. A reliable assessment of the site specific vulnerability to carbon loss is important information to enable effective and precise agricultural and environmental policy. In the frame of a research project to derive an updated map of peatland soils for the Federal State of Brandenburg, located in the North-East of Germany, 7725 soil investigations on peatland sites were carried out thereof 3729 were suitable for peatland subsidence analyses. These data, together with extensive legacy data consisting of approx. 246,650 soil profiles, allow for robust carbon loss estimations based on peatland subsidence records. Observed carbon losses amount to 0.234kg/m2*yr at (presently) uncultivated sites, 0.562kg/m2*yr for grassland and 0.645kg/m2*yr for arable land. These figures agree well with recently published data for similar landscapes and land management practices. Taking into account additional information on the initial peat thickness, the type of underlying substrate and the presence or absence of a mineral top layer, a robust site-specific assessment of vulnerability to carbon loss for agriculturally used peatlands has been done. It is shown that >50% of agriculturally used peatlands in Brandenburg are characterized by medium or high vulnerability to carbon loss.},

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities 1–4 . Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.},

abstract = {It is a well-established concept that nitrogen (N) limits plant growth and ecosystem production. However, whether N limits land carbon (C) sequestration - particularly in soil, the largest pool in the land - remains highly controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize 257 studies published in the literature with 512 paired comparisons to quantify the changes of ecosystem C processes in response to N addition. Our results show that N addition significantly increased aboveground, belowground, and litter C pools by 35.7, 23.0, and 20.9%, respectively, across all the studies. Despite the substantial increases in C inputs from vegetation to soil system, N addition resulted in no significant change in C storage of both organic horizon and mineral soil in forests and grasslands, but a significant 3.5% increase in agricultural ecosystems, largely due to less contribution from aboveground production and increases in DOC and soil respiration. Thus, N stimulation of C storage primarily occurred in plant pools but little in soil pools. Moreover, N-induced change in soil C storage was positively related to changes in belowground production but not to those in aboveground growth. Our global synthesis also suggests that earth system models need to treat soil C inputs from aboveground and belowground sources differentially for soil C sequestration in response to N deposition and fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fine root production is the largest component of belowground production and plays substantial roles in the biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. The increasing availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to human activities is expected to increase aboveground net primary production (ANNP), but the response of fine root production to N and P remains unclear. If roots respond to nutrients as ANNP, fine root production is anticipated to increase with increasing soil N and P. Here, by synthesizing data along the nutrient gradient from 410 natural habitats and from 469 N and/or P addition experiments, we showed that fine root production increased in terrestrial ecosystems with an average increase along the natural N gradient of up to 0.5 per cent with increasing soil N. Fine root production also increased with soil P in natural conditions, particularly at P < 300 mg kg(-1). With N, P and combined N + P addition, fine root production increased by a global average of 27, 21 and 40 per cent, respectively. However, its responses differed among ecosystems and soil types. The global average increases in fine root production are lower than those of ANNP, indicating that above- and belowground counterparts are coupled, but production allocation shifts more to aboveground with higher soil nutrients. Our results suggest that the increasing fertilizer use and combined N deposition at present and in the future will stimulate fine root production, together with ANPP, probably providing a significant influence on atmospheric CO(2) emissions.},

abstract = {1. Changes in the balance between soil carbon storage and release can significantly amplify or attenuate global warming. Although a lot of progress has been made in determining potential drivers of carbon release through large-scale decomposition experiments, climate predictions are still hampered by data limitation at a global scale as a result of high effort and measurement costs of comparative litter decomposition studies. 2. We introduce an innovative, cost-effective, well-standardised method to gather data on decomposition rate and litter stabilisation using commercially available tea bags as standardised test kits. By using two tea types with contrasting decomposability, we can construct a decomposition curve using a single measurement in time. The acquired Tea Bag Index (TBI) consists of two parameters describing decomposition rate (k) and litter stabilisation factor (S). 3. The method was tested for its sensitivity and robustness in contrasting ecosystems and biomes, confirming that the TBI is sensitive enough to discriminate between these systems. Within an ecosystem, TBI is responsive to differences in abiotic circumstances such as soil temperature and moisture content. The collected k and S values are in accordance with expectations based on decomposition process literature. They are therefore interpretable within the current knowledge framework. 4. Tea Bag Index is a unique, multifunctional method requiring few resources and minimal prior knowledge. The standardisation and simplicity of the method make it possible to collect comparable, globally distributed data through crowdsourcing. TBI can further provide an excellent decomposition reference and has the potential to increase reliability of soil carbon flux estimates based on extrapolations of decomposition data.},

abstract = {Understanding biodiversity-productivity relationships (BPRs) is of theoretical importance, and has important management implications. Most work on BPRs has focused on simple and/or experimentally assembled communities, and it is unclear how these observed BPRs can be extended to complex natural forest ecosystems. Using data from over 115,000 forest plots across the contiguous United States, we show that the bivariate BPRs are positive in dry climates and hump-shaped in mesic climates. When considering other site characteristics, BPRs change to neutral in dry climates and remain hump-shaped in humid sites. Our results indicate that climatic variation is an underlying determinant of contrasting BPRs observed across a large spatial extent, while both biotic factors (e.g., stand age and density) and abiotic factors (e.g., soil properties) can impact BPRs within a given climate unit. These findings suggest that tradeoffs need be made when considering whether to maximize productivity vs. conserve biodiversity, especially in mesic climates.},

abstract = {We used a gap-type forest ecosystem model to study how even- A nd uneven-aged management affected the carbon dynamics and timber production in boreal Norway spruce stands. In business-as-usual management, the intensity of thinnings (from below) and single-tree selective cuttings followed those recommended for even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged management (BSC) in practical forestry in Finland. Moreover, higher or lower basal area thresholds, and shorter or longer production cycles, were used in simulations. We found that, the mean annual carbon uptake, volume growth, and carbon stock in trees and harvested timber, were nearly the same under even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged (BSC) management, when assuming full seed crop in latter one. However, the carbon stock in the soil and ecosystem and the mean annual net ecosystem exchange were slightly smaller under BT. The carbon retention time was longer under BSC. The net present value (NPV with interest rate of 3 per cent) of timber production was clearly lower under BT, when the calculation was initiated at planting on clear-cutting area, in opposite to when initiating calculation a few years before the second thinning. Higher basal area thresholds and longer production cycles increased carbon stocks, carbon retention and timber yield, regardless of management system. On the other hand, the results of uneven-aged management (BSC) were very sensitive to the success of natural regeneration and ingrowth of seedlings, as a reduction of the seed crop by 25-75 per cent from the full seed crop decreases the volume growth by 44-74 per cent and timber yield up to 46 per cent.},

abstract = {Correct knowledge of disturbance ecology is essential for understanding the characteristic behavior of forest ecosystems and for guiding appropriate management strategies. However, the role of natural disturbances in shaping European mountain forest ecosystems has not been adequately studied, possibly because of the perception that the development of most European forests is primarily shaped by human influences and/or fine-scale gap-phase dynamics.In the present study, we investigate the long-term disturbance history of old protected forest dominated by Norway spruce in the Parangalitsa Reserve, Bulgaria. We used aerial photo interpretation and dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of wind, insect, and fire disturbances across a topographically complex landscape. Over the past 150. years wind has been the most important disturbance agent in this ecosystem and at least 18% of the forested area shows evidence of high-severity blowdowns. Windthrow patches ranged in size from <1. ha to >10. ha (minimum 0.11. ha, mean 0.16. ha, maximum 10. ha). Although small disturbances were much more frequent, few larger blowdowns accounted for most of the disturbed area. Pure coniferous and single-cohort coniferous forest patches were more affected by blowdowns than mixed coniferous-deciduous and multi-cohort coniferous forest patches. Although bark beetle (Ips typhographus) populations were large enough to cause mortality of some live trees, the populations did not grow to epidemic proportions during recent decades. Fire disturbance was of limited importance in the last 200. years and only two patches (4% of the study area) showed evidence of fire.The present research indicates that wind disturbances have been characteristic of these ecosystems at least over the past decades to centuries. Thus, blowdowns appear integral to the normal function and structure of the Picea-dominated mountain forests in the region and such events, in and of themselves, do not represent unhealthy forest conditions or environmental emergencies. Management strategies that aim to maintain these ecosystems within a natural range of variation should incorporate wind disturbances into the management strategy. The frequency and magnitude of future wind disturbances may be considered within the historical framework described in the current study to assess potential effects of climate change on altered disturbance regimes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Based on the 'European Mires Book' of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG), this article provides a composite map of national datasets as the first comprehensive peatland map for the whole of Europe. We also present estimates of the extent of peatlands and mires in each European country individually and for the entire continent. A minimum peat thickness criterion has not been strictly applied, to allow for (often historically determined) country-specific definitions. Our 'peatland' concept includes all 'mires', which are peatlands where peat is being formed. The map was constructed by merging national datasets in GIS while maintaining the mapping scales of the original input data. This 'bottom-up' approach indicates that the overall area of peatland in Europe is 593,727 km². Mires were found to cover more than 320,000 km² (around 54 % of the total peatland area). If shallow-peat lands (< 30 cm peat) in European Russia are also taken into account, the total peatland area in Europe is more than 1,000,000 km 2 , which is almost 10 % of the total surface area. Composite inventories of national peatland information, as presented here for Europe, may serve to identify gaps and priority areas for field survey, and help to cross-check and calibrate remote sensing based mapping approaches.},

abstract = {Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (“DW enrichment”) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.},

Statistical measures to prove model validity were mean error (ME=-0.001) and root mean square error (RMSE=0.119). In addition a number of tests were performed to make sure that the model has no systematic error for different types of site conditions and management activities. After this successful validation the CCB model is considered applicable for advisory service for arable fields on a wide range of site conditions.

abstract = {Fine roots support the water and nutrient demands of plants and supply carbon to soils. Quantifying turnover times of fine roots is crucial for modeling soil organic matter dynamics and constraining carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Here we challenge widely used isotope-based estimates suggesting the turnover of fine roots of trees to be as slow as a decade. By recording annual growth rings of roots from woody plant species, we show that mean chronological ages of fine roots vary from <1 to 12 years in temperate, boreal and sub-arctic forests. Radiocarbon dating reveals the same roots to be constructed from 10 ± 1 year (mean ± 1 SE) older carbon. This dramatic difference provides evidence for a time lag between plant carbon assimilation and production of fine roots, most likely due to internal carbon storage. The high root turnover documented here implies greater carbon inputs into soils than previously thought which has wide-ranging implications for quantifying ecosystem carbon allocation.},

abstract = {Peatlands play important ecological, economic and cultural roles in human well-being. Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23 million km2, approximately 2.84% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database – Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands. PEATMAP's data format and file structure are intended to allow it to be readily updated when previously undocumented peatlands are found and mapped, and when regional or national land cover maps are updated and refined.},

abstract = {Roots biomass is an important part of the forest ecosystems in their accumulation and turnover of organic carbon. The accumulation of tree biomass above or belowground largely depends on tree capacity to buffer stress and to react to different changes in the environment factors. Number of countries, including Bulgaria, signed the Kyoto Protocol and expressed their commitment to limit emissions of greenhouses gases. The forest vegetation plays a vital role in carbon stocks and cycling, both at national and global level, and has high potential to sequester carbon by increasing soil organic matter and root biomass. The roots are exclusively important component in carbon cycle representing near 30% of the total tree biomass. Meanwhile specific data, related to studies on root systems are insufficient. The aim of this paper is to present a quantitative data on fine and coarse root biomass of the main tree species in Bulgaria and compare the belowground stocks of plant mass and carbon accumulation in coniferous and broadleaved forests, clarifying the role of root biomass in total forest carbon stocks. The studies on coarse roots biomass and carbon stocks were performed following methods by Rodin et al., 1968, adapted by Lyubenova, 2009. The study on fine roots was performed using method of sequential coring technique (Ostonen et al., 2005). The determination of carbon content of living roots (coarse and fine tree roots and herbaceous roots) was performed following Turin's method (Kononova, 1966), modified in the laboratory (dichromate digestion at 125°C, 45 min in presence of Ag 2 SO 4 and FeSO 4). The carbon stock was estimated according to the methodology described in the Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF of IPCC (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_contents.html). The data on coarse and fine roots was analysed by multiply regression analyses (RDA) using the statistical software package Canoco for Windows 4.5 (Braak and Smilauer, 2002). The results suggested that the biomass of roots in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest was 7.2 kg.m -2 , in oak (Quercus frainetto Ten.) was 11.6 kg.m -2 , in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst was 28.1 kg.m -2 and in Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was 21 kg.m -2 . Comparison of the results showed that the biomass of coarse roots in coniferous tree species significantly exceeds the same in deciduous. Most likely this is related to differences in tree density and soil nutrient area, since deciduous were 600-700 trees ha -1 , while coniferous were 430 trees ha -1 . Following estimations the nutritive areas for broadleaved model trees were lower – 13-16 m 2 , while for coniferous they were 22-23 m 2 . The total carbon content in both fine and coarse roots of the studied tree species varied between 1,2 kg.m -2 (beech) and 3,87 kg.m -2 (Scots pine). Oak trees accumulate 2.6 kg.m -2 carbon in roots, while this content for spruce was 2,3 kg.m -2 . There was a decrease of both fine and course root biomass in deeper soil layers under all tree species. The results of present study confirmed that the belowground root biomass of forest ecosystems represent a substantial carbon pool.},

abstract = {The chemical structure of organic matter has been shown to be only marginally important for its decomposability by microorganisms. The question of why organic matter does accumulate in the face of powerful microbial degraders is thus key for understanding terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling. Here we demonstrate, based on an individual-based microbial community model, that social dynamics among microbes producing extracellular enzymes ('decomposers') and microbes exploiting the catalytic activities of others ('cheaters') regulate organic matter turnover. We show that the presence of cheaters increases nitrogen retention and organic matter build-up by downregulating the ratio of extracellular enzymes to total microbial biomass, allowing nitrogen-rich microbial necromass to accumulate. Moreover, increasing catalytic efficiencies of enzymes are outbalanced by a strong negative feedback on enzyme producers, leading to less enzymes being produced at the community level. Our results thus reveal a possible control mechanism that may buffer soil CO2 emissions in a future climate.},

abstract = {Global data sets of rooting depths, long-term means of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and soil texture were used to predict the probability of deep rooting around the globe. Rooting depths were considered to be deep if 5% or more of all roots in a profile were located below 2 m depth. Spatially explicit global predictions were based on empirical models relating the probability of deep rooting with climate and soil texture. Based on these predictions, deep roots are most likely to occur in seasonally dry, semiarid to humid tropical regions under savanna or thorn-scrub vegetation or under seasonally dry semideciduous to evergreen forests. Deep roots are least likely to occur in arctic, boreal or cool-temperate regions and in per-humid climates such as equatorial rain forests. Under warm-temperate to tropical climates, rooting depths are more likely to be deep in coarse-textured and fine-textured soil than in soils of medium texture. These observations agree well with predictions based on a previously published conceptual model, according to which water infiltration depths and evaporative demand are the main climatic factors to determine vertical root distributions on a global scale. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {<p>Peat humification or decomposition is a frequently used proxy to extract past time changes in hydrology and climate from peat bogs. During the past century several methods to determine changes in peat decomposition have been introduced. Most of these methods are operationally defined only and the chemical changes underlying the decomposition process are often poorly understood and lack validation. Owing to the chemically undefined nature of many humification analyses the comparison of results obtained by different methods is difficult. In this study we compared changes in peat decomposition proxies in cores of two peat bogs (K{\"{o}}nigsmoor, KK; Kleines Rotes Bruch, KRB) from the Harz Mountains (Germany) using C / N ratios, Fourier transform infrared spectra absorption (FTIR) intensities, Rock Eva<sup>{\textregistered}</sup> oxygen and hydrogen indices, <i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C and <i>$\delta$</i><sup>15</sup>N isotopic signatures and UV-absorption (UV-ABS) of NaOH peat extracts. In order to explain parallels and discrepancies between these methods, one of the cores was additionally analysed by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS). Pyrolysis-GC-MS data provide detailed information on a molecular level, which allows differentiation of both changes attributed to decomposition processes and changes in vegetation. Principal component analysis was used to identify and separate the effects of changes in vegetation pattern and decomposition processes because both may occur simultaneously upon changes in bog hydrology. Records of decomposition proxies show similar historical development at both sites, indicating external forcing such as climate as controlling the process. All decomposition proxies except UV-ABS and <i>$\delta$</i><sup>15</sup>N isotopes show similar patterns in their records and reflect to different extents signals of decomposition. The molecular composition of the KK core reveals that these changes are mainly attributed to decomposition processes and to a lesser extent to changes in vegetation. Changes in the molecular composition indicate that peat decomposition in the KK bog is mainly characterized by preferential decomposition of phenols and polysaccharides and relative enrichment of aliphatics during drier periods. Enrichment of lignin and other aromatics during decomposition was also observed but showed less variation than polysaccharides or aliphatics, and presumably reflects changes in vegetation associated with changes in hydrology of the bogs. Significant correlations with polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products were found for C / N ratios, FTIR-band intensities and for hydrogen index values, supporting that these decomposition indices provide reasonable information. Correlations of polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products with oxygen index values and <i>$\delta$</i><sup>13</sup>C was weaker, assumingly indicating carboxylation of the peat during drier periods and enrichment of isotopically lighter peat components during decomposition, respectively. FTIR, C / N ratio, pyrolysis-GC-MS analyses and Rock Eval hydrogen indices appear to reflect mass loss and related changes in the molecular peat composition during mineralization best. Pyrolysis-GC-MS allows disentangling the decomposition processes and vegetation changes. UV-ABS measurements of alkaline peat extracts show only weak correlation with other decomposition proxies and pyrolysis results as they mainly reflect the formation of humic acids through humification and to a lesser extent mass loss during mineralization.</p>},

abstract = {Laboratory studies show that introduction of fresh and easily decomposable organic carbon (OC) into soil-water systems can stimulate the decomposition of soil OC (SOC) via priming effects in temperate forests, shrublands, grasslands, and agro-ecosystems. However, priming effects are still not well understood in the field setting for temperate ecosystems and virtually nothing is known about priming effects (e.g., existence, frequency, and magnitude) in boreal ecosystems. In this study, a coupled dissolved OC (DOC) transport and microbial biomass dynamics model was developed to simultaneously simulate co-occurring hydrological, physical, and biological processes and their interactions in soil pore-water systems. The developed model was then used to examine the importance of priming effects in two black spruce forest soils, with and without underlying permafrost. Our simulations showed that priming effects were strongly controlled by the frequency and intensity of DOC input, with greater priming effects associated with greater DOC inputs. Sensitivity analyses indicated that priming effects were most sensitive to variations in the quality of SOC, followed by variations in microbial biomass dynamics (i.e., microbial death and maintenance respiration), highlighting the urgent need to better discern these key parameters in future experiments and to consider these dynamics in existing ecosystem models. Water movement carries DOC to deep soil layers that have high SOC stocks in boreal soils. Thus, greater priming effects were predicted for the site with favorable water movement than for the site with limited water flow, suggesting that priming effects might be accelerated for sites where permafrost degradation leads to the formation of dry thermokarst.},

abstract = {Aims We aim to construct a comprehensive global database of litter decomposition rate (k value) estimated by surface floor litterbags, and investigate the direct and indirect effects of impact factors such as geographic factors (latitude and altitude), climatic factors (mean annual tempePlrature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP) and litter quality factors (the contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and C:N ratio, lignin:N ratio) on litter decomposition. Methods We compiled a large data set of litter decomposition rates (k values) from 110 research sites and conducted simple, multiple regression and path analyses to explore the relationship between the k values and impact factors at the global scale. Important findings The k values tended to decrease with latitude (LAT) and lignin content (LIGN) of litter but increased with temperature, precipitation and nutrient concentrations at the large spatial scale. Single factor such as climate, litter quality and geographic variable could not explain litter decomposition rates well. However, the combination of total nutrient (TN) elements and C:N accounted for 70.2% of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. The combination of LAT, MAT, C:N and TN accounted for 87.54% of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. These results indicate that litter quality is the most important direct regulator of litter decomposition at the global scale. This data synthesis revealed significant relationships between litter decomposition rates and the combination of climatic factor (MAT) and litter quality (C:N, TN). The global-scale empirical relationships developed here are useful for a better understanding and modeling of the effects of litter quality and climate factors on litter decompsotion rates.},

abstract = {The 4‰ initiative launched by the French government at COP21 in Paris in December 2015 aspires to increase global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at a rate of 0.4% per year. We conducted a systematic literature review on SOC storage under agroforestry and conservation agriculture systems in sub-Saharan Africa, where we reported 66 and 33 cases for both systems respectively. The results showed that SOC storage rates were significantly higher than 4‰ yr-1in fallows and in multistrata agroforestry systems (P = 0.0001 and 0.0178, respectively), but not in alley cropping and parklands systems. For conservation agriculture, SOC storage rates were only significantly higher than 4‰ yr-1(P = 0.0438) when all three principles were applied, i.e. no- or minimum tillage combined with crop residue retention and intercropping or rotation. The data showed very large variability in SOC storage rates as the result of various factors, including previous land-use history, experimental set up and approach used to determine SOC storage (diachronic versus synchronic approach), soil type, depth of soil sampling, type of crops and management, and duration of the experiment. SOC storage rates significantly decreased with time in the agroforestry systems (P = 0.0328). However, we were unable to find significant relationships with initial SOC stocks or tree density. Given the limited published data and the high variability in results, no significant relationships between SOC storage rates and site variables were found for conservation agriculture. We argue that there is a potential for SOC storage in agricultural soils of sub-Saharan Africa, as illustrated by SOC gaps observed on smallholder farms. Low SOC levels are, however, to a great extent the result of limited resources of most smallholder farmers. Practices such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture can restore SOC in these soils, but the 4‰ initiative has to be implemented on the grounds of the positive impact on crop productivity rather than on climate change mitigation. The efficiency in doing so will depend on the specific situations and will need economic support to smallholder farmers, including the promotion of good markets for sale of extra produce and for input supply, effective private support and policy, such as credit schemes and subsidies for inputs, and efficient extension services which incentivize farmers to invest in new technologies.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to predict and map SOC stocks at different depth intervals within the upper 1-m depth using profile depth distribution functions and ordinary kriging. These approaches were tested for the state of Indiana as a case study. A total of 464 pedons representing 204 soil series was obtained from the National Soil Survey Center database. Another 48 soil profile samples were collected to better represent the heterogeneity of the environmental variables. Two methods were used to model the depth distribution of the SOC stocks using negative exponential profile depth functions. In Procedure A, the functions to describe the depth distribution of volumetric C content for each soil profile were fitted using nonlinear least squares. In Procedure B, the exponential functions were fitted to describe the depth distribution of the cumulative SOC stocks. The parameters of the functions were interpolated for the entire study area using ordinary kriging on 81% of the data points (n = 414). The integral of the exponential function up to the desired depth was used to predict SOC stocks within the 0- to 1-, 0- to 0.5-, and 0.5- to 1-m depth intervals. These estimates were validated using the remaining 19% (n = 98) of the data. Procedure B showed a higher prediction accuracy for all depths, with higher rand lower RMSE values. The highest prediction accuracy (r = 0.75, RMSE = 2.89 kg m -2) was obtained for SOC stocks in the 0- to 0.5-m depth interval. Using Procedure B, SOC stocks within the top 1 m of Indiana soils were estimated to be 0.90 Pg C. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract = {We combined year-round eddy covariance with biometry and biomass harvests along a chronosequence of boreal forest stands that were 1, 6, 15, 23, 40, similar to 74, and similar to 154 years old to understand how ecosystem production and carbon stocks change during recovery from stand-replacing crown fire. Live biomass (C-live) was low in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, and increased following a logistic pattern to high levels in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Carbon stocks in the forest floor (C-forest floor) and coarse woody debris (C-CWD) were comparatively high in the 1-year-old stand, reduced in the 6- through 40-year-old stands, and highest in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Total net primary production (TNPP) was reduced in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, highest in the 23- through 74-year-old stands and somewhat reduced in the 154-year-old stand. The NPP decline at the 154-year-old stand was related to increased autotrophic respiration rather than decreased gross primary production (GPP). Net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated by integrated eddy covariance, indicated the 1- and 6-year-old stands were losing carbon, the 15-year-old stand was gaining a small amount of carbon, the 23- and 74-year-old stands were gaining considerable carbon, and the 40- and 154-year-old stands were gaining modest amounts of carbon. The recovery from fire was rapid; a linear fit through the NEP observations at the 6- and 15-year-old stands indicated the transition from carbon source to sink occurred within 11-12 years. The NEP decline at the 154-year-old stand appears related to increased losses from C-live by tree mortality and possibly from C-forest floor by decomposition. Our findings support the idea that NPP, carbon production efficiency (NPP/GPP), NEP, and carbon storage efficiency (NEP/TNPP) all decrease in old boreal stands.},

abstract = {Controls on the fate of $\sim$277 Pg of soil organic carbon (C) stored in permafrost peatland soils remain poorly understood despite the potential for a significant positive feedback to climate change. Our objective was to quantify the temperature, moisture, organic matter, and microbial controls on soil organic carbon (SOC) losses following permafrost thaw in peat soils across Alaska. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and methane (CH4 ) emissions from peat samples collected at active layer and permafrost depths when incubated aerobically and anaerobically at -5, -0.5, +4, and +20 °C. Temperature had a strong, positive effect on C emissions; global warming potential (GWP) was >3× larger at 20 °C than at 4 °C. Anaerobic conditions significantly reduced CO2 emissions and GWP by 47% at 20 °C but did not have a significant effect at -0.5 °C. Net anaerobic CH4 production over 30 days was 7.1 ± 2.8 $\mu$g CH4 -C gC(-1) at 20 °C. Cumulative CO2 emissions were related to organic matter chemistry and best predicted by the relative abundance of polysaccharides and proteins (R(2) = 0.81) in SOC. Carbon emissions (CO2 -C + CH4 -C) from the active layer depth peat ranged from 77% larger to not significantly different than permafrost depths and varied depending on the peat type and peat decomposition stage rather than thermal state. Potential SOC losses with warming depend not only on the magnitude of temperature increase and hydrology but also organic matter quality, permafrost history, and vegetation dynamics, which will ultimately determine net radiative forcing due to permafrost thaw.},

abstract = {The potential of forest-based bioenergy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when displacing fossil-based energy must be balanced with forest carbon implications related to biomass harvest. We integrate life cycle assessment (LCA) and forest carbon analysis to assess total GHG emissions of forest bioenergy over time. Application of the method to case studies of wood pellet and ethanol production from forest biomass reveals a substantial reduction in forest carbon due to bioenergy production. For all cases, harvest-related forest carbon reductions and associated GHG emissions initially exceed avoided fossil fuel-related emissions, temporarily increasing overall emissions. In the long term, electricity generation from pellets reduces overall emissions relative to coal, although forest carbon losses delay net GHG mitigation by 16-38 years, depending on biomass source (harvest residues/standing trees). Ethanol produced from standing trees increases overall emissions throughout 100 years of continuous production: ethanol from residues achieves reductions after a 74 year delay. Forest carbon more significantly affects bioenergy emissions when biomass is sourced from standing trees compared to residues and when less GHG-intensive fuels are displaced. In all cases, forest carbon dynamics are significant. Although study results are not generalizable to all forests, we suggest the integrated LCA/forest carbon approach be undertaken for bioenergy studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Transition to bioenergy has been identified in Sweden as one strategy to mitigate climate change and decrease the current dependency on fossil fuel. In this study, life cycle assessment was used to evaluate and compare the climate impacts of SRCW systems, for the purpose of evaluating key factors influencing the climate change mitigation potential of SRCW grown on agricultural land in Sweden. Seven different scenarios were defined and analysed to identify the factors with the most influence on the climate. A carbon balance model was used to model carbon fluxes between soil, biomass and atmosphere under Swedish growing conditions. The results indicated that SRCW can act as a temporary carbon sink and therefore has a mitigating effect on climate change. The most important factor in obtaining a high climate change-mitigating effect was shown to be high yield. Low yield gave the worst mitigating effect of the seven scenarios, but it was still better than the effect of the reference systems, district heating produced from coal or natural gas.},

abstract = {Climate change and changes in land use will alter the stores of carbon and turnover of soil organic matter. We have used a theory for carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems to analyse changes in soil organic matter turnover in coniferous forests. The central concepts of the theory are a continuously changing substrate quality, a constant decomposer efficiency and a climatically controlled decomposer growth rate. Measurements on litter production and soil carbon stores from field experiments have been used to successfully validate the model predictions. Measured litter production increased with increasing temperature but the response was not identical for forests of different vegetation types which reflect variations in productivity. The temperature response of needle-litter production and decomposition rate were strongest in the most productive forests and weakest for the low productive forests. Initial decay rates of soil C store from steady state showed the same trend in temperature response as decay of a single litter cohort did, but the absolute values are 16% of the decay rates of a single litter cohort. Predicted soil C ranged from 5 to 9 kg C m-2. There exists a remarkable variation in forest soil C store response to temperature; the magnitude and even the sign depends on productivity as defined by vegetation type. The assumption that, in general, decomposition rates increase more than NPP with temperature, and consequently, soil C stores should decrease in response to a climate warming, seems therefore too simplistic.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter is the largest terrestrial carbon pool1. The pool size depends on the balance between formation of soil organic matter from decomposition of plant litter and its mineralization to inorganic carbon. Knowledge of soil organic matter formation remains limited2 and current C numerical models assume that stable soil organic matter is formed primarily from recalcitrant plant litter3. However, labile components of plant litter could also form mineral-stabilized soil organic matter4. Here we followed the decomposition of isotopically labelled above-ground litter and its incorporation into soil organic matter over three years in a grassland in Kansas,USA, and used laboratory incubations to determine the decay rates and pool structure of litter-derived organic matter. Early in decomposition, soil organic matter formed when non-structural compounds were lost from litter. Soil organic matter also formed at the end of decomposition, when both non-structural and structural compounds were lost at similar rates.We conclude that two pathways yield soil organic matter effciently. A dissolved organic matter–microbial path occurs early in decomposition when litter loses mostly non-structural compounds, which are incorporated into microbial biomass at high rates, resulting in effcient soil organic matter formation. An equally effcient physical-transfer path occurs when litter fragments move into soil.},

abstract = {Improved global estimates of terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration are critical for predicting the rate of change in atmospheric CO(2). The oxygen isotopic composition of atmospheric CO(2) can be used to estimate these fluxes because oxygen isotopic exchange between CO(2) and water creates distinct isotopic flux signatures. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) is known to accelerate this exchange in leaves, but the possibility of CA activity in soils is commonly neglected. Here, we report widespread accelerated soil CO(2) hydration. Exchange was 10-300 times faster than the uncatalyzed rate, consistent with typical population sizes for CA-containing soil microorganisms. Including accelerated soil hydration in global model simulations modifies contributions from soil and foliage to the global CO(18)O budget and eliminates persistent discrepancies existing between model and atmospheric observations. This enhanced soil hydration also increases the differences between the isotopic signatures of photosynthesis and respiration, particularly in the tropics, increasing the precision of CO(2) gross fluxes obtained by using the delta(18)O of atmospheric CO(2) by 50%.},

abstract = {Uncertainty was quantified for an inventory estimating change in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from modifications in land use and management across US agricultural lands between 1982 and 1997. This inventory was conducted using a modified version of a carbon (C) accounting method developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Probability density functions (PDFs) were derived for each input to the IPCC model, including reference SOC stocks, land use/management activity data, and management factors. Change in C storage was estimated using a Monte-Carlo approach with 50 000 iterations, by randomly selecting values from the PDFs after accounting for dependencies in the model inputs. Over the inventory period, mineral soils had a net gain of 10.8 Tg C yr?1, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 6.5 to 15.3 Tg C yr?1. Most of this gain was due to setting-aside lands in the Conservation Reserve Program. In contrast, managed organic soils lost 9.4 Tg C yr?1, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 6.4 to 13.3 Tg C yr?1. Combining these gains and losses in SOC, US agricultural soils accrued 1.3 Tg C yr?1 due to land use and management change, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from a loss of 4.4 Tg C yr?1 to a gain of 6.9 Tg C yr?1. Most of the uncertainty was attributed to management factors for tillage, land use change between cultivated and uncultivated conditions, and C loss rates from managed organic soils. Based on the uncertainty, we are not able to conclude with 95% confidence that change in US agricultural land use and management between 1982 and 1997 created a net C sink for atmospheric CO2.},

abstract = {The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil carbon (> 20cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but the dynamics of deep soil carbon remains poorly understood. Therefore, radiocarbon activity ($\Delta$D(14) C), which is a function of the age of carbon, may help to understand rates of soil carbon biodegradation and stabilization. We analyzed the published (14) C contents in 122 profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension of a linear mixed effects model whose inference was based on the parallel combination of two algorithms, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and the Metropolis-Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil $\Delta$(14) C profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model produced insightful predictions of soil $\Delta$(14) C as dependent on depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling (R2 = 0.68). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and mineralogy.

abstract = {Understanding temporal variation in habitat selection and browsing intensity by large herbivores is fundamental because of their large impact on the ecosystems. I studied the annual variation in winter browsing pressure on young trees and habitat selection by moose Alces alces over a ten year period. Specifically, the relationships between browsing pressure on Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and two birch species (Betula ssp.) and three explanatory variables 2013 1) availability of forage, 2) moose density (estimated by pellet group counts) and 3) snow cover was studied. At a larger spatial scale (forest stand level) the relationship between moose habitat selection between three different habitat types (forest <30 yr, forest>30 yr and mire) and two explanatory variables, 1) snow condition and 2) moose density, were studied. Browsing pressure on Scots pine, the dominating food plant, was related to forage availability, moose density and snow condition. No significant relationships between any of the three explanatory variables and browsing pressure on the two birch species were found. Moose selection for certain habitats varied between years and was affected by number of days with >0.10 m of snow. Habitat selection was not significantly related to moose density and the relationship between overall moose density and habitat specific moose densities was proportional within the studied density range. These findings have implications for understanding varying browsing patterns 2013 and will affect both the ability to predict herbivores' effect on the forest ecosystem. A snow dependent browsing pattern also indicates that one can expect a long term decrease in browsing pressure on the tree and shrub layer as a consequence of the ongoing large-scale climate change.},

abstract = {Stakeholder engagement, collaboration, or participation, shared learning or fact-finding, have become buzz words and hardly any environmental assessment or modelling effort today can be presented without some kind of reference to stakeholders and their involvement in the process. This is clearly a positive development, but in far too many cases stakeholders have merely been paid lip service and their engagement has consequentially been quite nominal. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that better decisions are implemented with less conflict and more success when they are driven by stakeholders, that is by those who will be bearing their consequences. Participatory modelling, with its various types and clones, has emerged as a powerful tool that can (a) enhance the stakeholders knowledge and understanding of a system and its dynamics under various conditions, as in collaborative learning, and (b) identify and clarify the impacts of solutions to a given problem, usually related to supporting decision making, policy, regulation or management. In this overview paper we first look at the different types of stakeholder modelling, and compare participatory modelling to other frameworks that involve stakeholder participation. Based on that and on the experience of the projects reported in this issue and elsewhere, we draw some lessons and generalisations. We conclude with an outline of some future directions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Forest-based bioenergy plays an important role in climate mitigation for limiting global mean temperature increase to below 2 °C. The greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of three forest-based bioenergy systems from the USA, Canada and Spain supplying wood pellets for electricity in the UK were evaluated by conducting lifecycle assessments and forest carbon modelling of the three forest systems. Cumulative emissions were analysed by calculating the forest carbon stock change and net GHG emissions balance of the forest-based bioenergy electricity. The analysis considered both the replacement of the existing electricity mix with bioenergy electricity and forest management with and without bioenergy use. The supply chain emissions and forest carbon balances indicated that GHG emission reductions are possible. However, the cumulative net GHG balance at forest landscape scale revealed that the reduction potential is limited, potentially with no GHG reductions in fast growing forests with shorter rotations, while slow growing forest systems with longer rotations result in greater GHG reductions. This means that the maximum climate benefit is delivered at a different point in time for different forest systems. To evaluate the climate change mitigation potential of forest-based bioenergy it is therefore necessary to consider the management, utilisation and relevant counterfactual of the whole forest and its products. In terms of climate change mitigation potential and minimising possible negative impacts that would require multi-level governance.},

abstract = {Windthrows are among the most important disturbances of forest ecosystems in Europe, with expected increasing frequency due to climate change. However, surprisingly little is known about soil carbon dynamics after windthrow mainly due to missing field assessments. After a large windthrow event in the High Tatra Mountains in 2004 three soil monitoring plots were established, one at a non-harvested windthrow left for natural succession, one at a harvested windthrow and one at a reference forest site which remained unaffected by the storm event. No loss in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks was detected at the two windthrow sites with three inventories over the 3.5years after the storm event. However, shifts within the organic layers and the mineral soil toward more decomposed organic matter were found. Increasing C/N ratios at the harvested windthrow site indicate that newly established herbaceous vegetation compensated the decline in tree litter input. At the non-harvested windthrow site a flush of needle litter from broken trees helped to sustain SOC stocks. In contrast, SOC stocks at the reference forest increased by 2.2Mgha -1year -1 with major SOC stock accumulation in the forest floor. An assessment of the sample size required to detect future SOC changes revealed that at the windthrow sites a similar sample size is required as in the undisturbed reference forest. Small scale heterogeneity was at such a level that paired sampling did not significantly reduce the number of required samples. However, the separation of forest floor layers and mineral soil was a major obstacle for efficient forest soil carbon monitoring. The required number of soil samples could be decreased by 45% with a simultaneous sampling of forest floor and upper mineral soil, leading to more reliable SOC inventories. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of ??-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of ??-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 ??C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem service science has made much progress in framing core concepts and approaches, but there is still debate around the notion of cultural services, and a growing consensus that ecosystem use and ecosystem service use should be clearly differentiated. Part of the debate resides in the fact that the most significant sources of conflict around natural resource management arise from the multiple managements (uses) of ecosystems, rather than from the multiple uses of ecosystem services. If the ecosystem approach or the ecosystem service paradigm are to be implemented at national levels, there is an urgent need to disentangle what are often semantic issues, revise the notion of cultural services, and more broadly, practically define the less tangible ecosystem services on which we depend. This is a critical step to identifying suitable ways to manage trade-offs and promote adaptive management. Here we briefly review the problems associated with defining and quantifying cultural ecosystem services and suggest there could be merit in discarding this term for the simpler non-material ecosystem services. We also discuss the challenges in valuing the invaluable, and suggest that if we are to keep ecosystem service definition focused on the beneficiary, we need to further classify these challenging services, for example by differentiating services to individuals from services to communities. Also, we suggest that focussing on ecosystem service change rather than simply service delivery, and identifying common boundaries relevant for both people and ecosystems, would help meet some of these challenges.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon is a key soil property related to soil fertility, aggregate stability and the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. Existing soil maps and inventories can rarely be used to monitor the state and evolution in soil organic carbon content due to their poor spatial resolution, lack of consistency and high updating costs. Visible and Near Infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an alternative method to provide cheap and high-density soil data. However, there are still some uncertainties on its capacity to produce reliable predictions for areas characterized by large soil diversity. Using a large-scale EU soil survey of about 20,000 samples and covering 23 countries, we assessed the performance of reflectance spectroscopy for the prediction of soil organic carbon content. The best calibrations achieved a root mean square error ranging from 4 to 15 g C kg(-1) for mineral soils and a root mean square error of 50 g C kg(-1) for organic soil materials. Model errors are shown to be related to the levels of soil organic carbon and variations in other soil properties such as sand and clay content. Although errors are ∼5 times larger than the reproducibility error of the laboratory method, reflectance spectroscopy provides unbiased predictions of the soil organic carbon content. Such estimates could be used for assessing the mean soil organic carbon content of large geographical entities or countries. This study is a first step towards providing uniform continental-scale spectroscopic estimations of soil organic carbon, meeting an increasing demand for information on the state of the soil that can be used in biogeochemical models and the monitoring of soil degradation.},

abstract = {The mechanisms behind the (13)C enrichment of organic matter with increasing soil depth in forests are unclear. To determine if (13)C discrimination during respiration could contribute to this pattern, we compared delta(13)C signatures of respired CO(2) from sieved mineral soil, litter layer and litterfall with measurements of delta(13)C and delta(15)N of mineral soil, litter layer, litterfall, roots and fungal mycelia sampled from a 68-year-old Norway spruce forest stand planted on previously cultivated land. Because the land was subjected to ploughing before establishment of the forest stand, shifts in delta(13)C in the top 20 cm reflect processes that have been active since the beginning of the reforestation process. As (13)C-depleted organic matter accumulated in the upper soil, a 1.0 per thousand delta(13)C gradient from -28.5 per thousand in the litter layer to -27.6 per thousand at a depth of 2-6 cm was formed. This can be explained by the 1 per thousand drop in delta(13)C of atmospheric CO(2) since the beginning of reforestation together with the mixing of new C (forest) and old C (farmland). However, the isotopic change of the atmospheric CO(2) explains only a portion of the additional 1.0 per thousand increase in delta(13)C below a depth of 20 cm. The delta(13)C of the respired CO(2) was similar to that of the organic matter in the upper soil layers but became increasingly (13)C enriched with depth, up to 2.5 per thousand relative to the organic matter. We hypothesise that this (13)C enrichment of the CO(2) as well as the residual increase in delta(13)C of the organic matter below a soil depth of 20 cm results from the increased contribution of (13)C-enriched microbially derived C with depth. Our results suggest that (13)C discrimination during microbial respiration does not contribute to the (13)C enrichment of organic matter in soils. We therefore recommend that these results should be taken into consideration when natural variations in delta(13)C of respired CO(2) are used to separate different components of soil respiration or ecosystem respiration.},

abstract = {Soil organic C (SOC) in agricultural soils is affected by cropping system. In order to compare the impact of ley-dominated and cereal monoculture rotations on soil properties, a series of experiments was started in Sweden in the early 1980s. This study quantified the effect of rotations and N fertilisation on SOC stocks and microbial community composition. After 35 years, soil samples taken down to 50-cm depth at two sites with contrasting soil texture (clay and loam) were analysed for soil C and N, bulk density and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content. Significant increases in SOC concentrations and stocks were found in the ley-dominated rotation compared with the cereal monoculture rotation, the difference being 0.36 and 0.59 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in the topsoil (0–20 cm) for sites with the clay and loam texture, respectively, in average over N fertiliser levels. Nitrogen fertilisation increased SOC stocks significantly in the cereal monoculture, but not in the ley-dominated rotation. In the loam, SOC responses in the subsoil were almost as high as those in the topsoil, but they were insignificant in the clay soil. These results indicate that soil texture and structure can have a great impact on the potential of subsoils to sequester C, which requires attention when scaling up SOC sequestration rates for regional or global assessments.},

ISBN 978-91-506-2423-6. In this thesis freeze-thaw along roads in northern Sweden is examined. The examinations are put in a context of changing climate and its amplification towards the Arctic region on earth. The research focuses on the impact of a warmer climate on ground freeze-thaw and in exten-sion road maintenance in the region. The investigation is presented through two scientific papers, where the first examines how ground temperatures are developed during a single frost season experiment, where a natural accumulation of snow cover and a continual removal of snow cover occur respectively. In the second paper, ground temperature data from sub-Arctic Sweden that has been logged by the Swedish Transport Administration, has been collected and freeze-thaw cycles have been calculated and analysed. The results are related to regional landscape factors and are in the context of regional climate change discussed to reach understanding of challenges for road maintenance in the region and opportunities to reach resilience. The results in Paper 1 show that also a thin cover of snow has impact on the freeze-thaw frequency, duration and intensity that occur in and on the surface of the ground. Furthermore the results show that the ground temperatures rise in due to an increase in snow cover amounts and that this process occurs in several steps. Paper 2 shows that the occurrence of ground freeze-thaw is affected by the proximity to open waters. Warmer temperatures in the air may cause later ice freeze-up and earlier ice break-up on lakes, rivers and on the Gulf of Bothnia and roads in northern Sweden are in general situated on the coast or near rivers. Ground temperatures around 0 °C has a high negative impact on road stability and a warmer and wetter climate in northern Sweden may thus increase road deterioration. The economic development in Sweden stays dependent on extraction of natural resources in sub-Arctic Sweden and thus it is of major concern to main-tain and improve road infrastructure in the region.},

abstract = {Assessment and monitoring of soil organic matter (SOM) quality are important for determining and developing management practices that will enhance and maintain the productivity of agricultural soils. This requires routine analysis of multiple soil parameters, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Research has suggested that visible near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) may be used as a rapid and cost-efficient tool for SOM quality assessment. In this study, VNIRS (400-2498nm) was used for the first time to simultaneously predict microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), water-extractable organic N (WEON), light fraction organic matter N (LFOMN), particulate organic matter N (POMN), soil total N (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil C/N ratio as soil SOM quality indicators in Chernozemic soils of western Canada. The soil samples (n=200) were collected at the 0-15cm depth from a crop rotation experiment conducted at 6 sites in 2010 and 2011. After removal of outliers (five samples) identified by principal components analysis (PCA), 75% of the sample set was randomly selected for calibration (n=146) and the remainder used for validation (n=49). Modified partial least squares regression with cross-validation was used to develop prediction models. The reliability of the models was assessed using the coefficient of determination in validation (R2
V) and the ratio of standard deviation of the reference data in the validation set to the standard error of prediction (RPDV). The VNIRS predictions were considered reliable for LFOMN, POMN, TN, and SOC (R2
V>0.80, RPDV>2.4), as well as for MBN (R2
V=0.74, RPDV=1.93), but less reliable for WEON (R2
V=0.67, RPDV=1.70) and soil C/N ratio (R2
V=0.54, RPDV=1.45). This study showed that VNIRS has the potential as a non-destructive and cost-efficient tool for rapid determination of SOM quality indicators. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {While there have been many valuable individual studies of the effects of agroforestry on changes in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this information has not yet been brought together to provide an overall assessment of the effects of agroforestry. We therefore compiled and analysed data from 109 earlier observations from 56 peer-reviewed publications of net rates of change of biomass and/or soil carbon (C) stocks in agroforestry systems, and from 26 data sets from 15 peer-reviewed publications of net changes in the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). We categorized agroforestry into two distinct types: tree-crop coexistence types where trees and agricultural crops are grown together (type 1) and tree-crop rotation type where trees and crops are grown alternately on the same piece of land (type 2). We primarily assessed the changes in C storage and net GHG emissions between agriculture and type 1 agroforestry. The data showed high variability in net C sequestration rates in both biomass and soils depending on the type of agroforestry, with reported C increments ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 t C ha-1y-1in biomass and 1.0 to 7.4 t C ha-1y-1in soils. On average, type 1 stands sequestered 3.8 ± 1.3 t C ha-1y-1in above-ground biomass, with no evidence of changed rates for stands aged 5-25 years. All available studies exclusively reported increases in soil C stocks, with highest reported soil C sequestration rates of more than 8 t C ha-1y-1for the first year after agroforestry establishment. Averaged across all observations, soil C sequestration rates were about 2 t C ha-1y-1in youngest stands that gradually diminished with time since stand establishment. Overall, type 1 agroforestry stands (at an average age of 14 years) sequestered 7.2 ± 2.8 t C ha-1y-1, with biomass and soil C sequestration contributing about 70% and 30% of that increment, respectively. Soils under agroforestry also oxidised 1.6 ± 1.0 kg CH4ha-1y-1and emitted 7.7 ± 3.3 kg N2O ha-1y-1. Comparing agroforestry and adjacent agricultural lands, we found only minor differences in net CH4and N2O emissions, with no clear overall direction of change. Overall, agroforestry was estimated to contribute to mitigating 27 ± 14 t CO2equivalents ha-1y-1at least for the first 14 years after establishment. It is suggested that future studies should consider strategic approaches for data acquisition that develop comprehensive approaches to quantify all components of the GHG balance, relate net GHG emissions with quantification of the yield of produce, and develop models to summarise the findings.},

abstract = {Fine roots form one of the most significant components contributing to carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. We study here the effect of variation in root diameter classes, sampling depth and the inclusion of understorey vegetation root biomass in fine root biomass (FRB) estimates. The FRB estimates for different forest biomes are updated using a database of 512 forest stands compiled from the literature. We also investigate the relationships between environmental or forest stand variables and fine root biomass (≤2mm in diameter) at the stand (gm-2) and tree level (g tree-1). The FRB estimates extrapolated for the whole rooting depth were 526±321gm-2, 775±474gm-2 and 776±518gm-2 for boreal, temperate and tropical forests, respectively, and were 26-67% higher than those based on the original sampling depths used. We found significant positive correlations between ≤1 and ≤2mm diameter roots and between ≤2 and ≤5mm roots. The FRB estimates, standardized to the ≤2mm diameter class, were 34-60% higher and 25-29% smaller than those standardized to the ≤1mm and ≤5mm diameter classes, respectively. The FRB of the understorey vegetation accounted for 31% of the total FRB in boreal forests and 20% in temperate forests. The results indicate that environmental factors (latitude, mean annual precipitation, elevation, temperature) or forest stand factors (life form, age, basal area, density) can not explain a significant amount of the variation in the total FRB and a maximum of 30% that in the FRB of trees at the stand level, whereas the mean basal area of the forest stand can explain 49% of the total FRB and 79% of the FRB of trees at the tree level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In order to understand the coupling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, it is necessary to understand C and N-use efficiencies of microbial soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. While important controls of those efficiencies by microbial community adaptations have been shown at the scale of a soil pore, an abstract simplified representation of community adaptations is needed at ecosystem scale. Therefore we developed the soil enzyme allocation model (SEAM), which takes a holistic, partly optimality based approach to describe C and N dynamics at the spatial scale of an ecosystem and time-scales of years and longer. We explicitly modelled community adaptation strategies of resource allocation to extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM decomposition. Using SEAM, we explored whether alternative strategy-hypotheses can have strong effects on SOM and inorganic N cycling. Results from prototypical simulations and a calibration to observations of an intensive pasture site showed that the so-called revenue enzyme allocation strategy was most viable. This strategy accounts for microbial adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount of different SOM resources, and supported the largest microbial biomass under a wide range of conditions. Predictions of the holistic SEAM model were qualitatively similar to precitions of the SYMPHONY model, which explicitly represents competing microbial guilds. With adaptive enzyme allocation under conditions of high C/N ratio of litter inputs, N that was formerly locked in slowly degrading SOM pools was made accessible, whereas with high N inputs, N was sequestered in SOM and protected from leaching. The findings imply that it is important for ecosystem scale models to account for adaptation of C and N use efficiencies in order to represent C-N couplings. The combination of stoichiometry and optimality principles is a promising route to yield simple formulations of such adaptations at community level suitable for incorporation into land surface models.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Drought stress is a dominant constraint to crop production. Breeding crops with adapted root systems for effective uptake of water represents a novel strategy to increase crop drought resistance. Due to complex interaction between root traits and high diversity of hydrological conditions, modeling provides important information for trait based selection. In this work we use a root architecture model combined with a soil-hydrological model to analyze whether there is a root system ideotype of general adaptation to drought or water uptake efficiency of root systems is a function of specific hydrological conditions. This was done by modeling transpiration of 48 root architectures in 16 drought scenarios with distinct soil textures, rainfall distributions, and initial soil moisture availability. We find that the efficiency in water uptake of root architecture is strictly dependent on the hydrological scenario. Even dense and deep root systems are not superior in water uptake under all hydrological scenarios. Our results demonstrate that mere architectural description is insufficient to find root systems of optimum functionality. We find that in environments with sufficient rainfall before the growing season, root depth represents the key trait for the exploration of stored water, especially in fine soils. Root density, instead, especially near the soil surface, becomes the most relevant trait for exploiting soil moisture when plant water supply is mainly provided by rainfall events during the root system development. We therefore concluded that trait based root breeding has to consider root systems with specific adaptation to the hydrology of the target environment.},

Particular emphasis is placed on the need to balance production objectives in the context of ecological sustainability. Topics suc h as f eeding beha viour, feeding management, the relationship of body condition score to nutritional sufficiency, daily and seasonal feed intake requirements, and pasture species selection are also presented. The marketability of venison and the long-term acceptance of deer farming will be largely shaped by consumer perception of the animal welfare implications of production techniques, the ecological impact of production and an industry image that reflects social responsibility. Development of efficient feeding systems for farmed deer will impact on all of these areas.},

abstract = {Agroforestry systems are land use management systems in which trees are grown in combination with crops or pasture in the same field. In silvoarable systems, trees are intercropped with arable crops, and in silvopastoral systems trees are combined with pasture for livestock. These systems may produce forage and timber as well as providing ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation. Carbon (C) is stored in the aboveground and belowground biomass of the trees, and the transfer of organic matter from the trees to the soil can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Few studies have assessed the impact of agroforestry systems on carbon storage in soils in temperate climates, as most have been undertaken in tropical regions. This study assessed five silvoarable systems and one silvopastoral system in France. All sites had an agroforestry system with an adjacent, purely agricultural control plot. The land use management in the inter-rows in the agroforestry systems and in the control plots were identical. The age of the study sites ranged from 6 to 41 years after tree planting. Depending on the type of soil, the sampling depth ranged from 20 to 100 cm and SOC stocks were assessed using equivalent soil masses. The aboveground biomass of the trees was also measured at all sites. In the silvoarable systems, the mean organic carbon stock accumulation rate in the soil was 0.24 (0.09–0.46) Mg C ha−1 yr−1 at a depth of 30 cm and 0.65 (0.004–1.85) Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the tree biomass. Increased SOC stocks were also found in deeper soil layers at two silvoarable sites. Young plantations stored additional SOC but mainly in the soil under the rows of trees, possibly as a result of the herbaceous vegetation growing in the rows. At the silvopastoral site, the SOC stock was significantly greater at a depth of 30–50 cm than in the control. Overall, this study showed the potential of agroforestry systems to store C in both soil and biomass in temperate regions.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of subsoil carbon (C) deposition by deep-rooted crops in mitigating climate change and maintaining soil health, the quantification of root C input and its microbial utilization and stabilization below 1 m depth remains unexplored. We studied C input by three perennial deep-rooted plants (lucerne, kernza, and rosinweed) grown in a unique 4-m deep RootTower facility. 13C multiple pulse labeling was applied to trace C flows in roots, rhizodeposition, and soil as well as 13C incorporation into microbial groups by phospholipid fatty acids and the long-term stabilization of microbial residues by amino sugars. The ratio of rhizodeposited 13C in the PLFA and amino sugar pools was used to compare the relative microbial stability of rhizodeposited C across depths and plant species. Belowground C allocation between roots, rhizodeposits, and living and dead microorganisms indicated depth dependent plant investment. Rhizodeposition as a fraction of the total belowground C input declined from the topsoil (0–25 cm) to the deepest layer (360 cm), i.e., from 35%, 45%, and 36%–8.0%, 2.5%, and 2.7% for lucerne, kernza, and rosinweed, respectively, where lucerne had greater C input than the other species between 340 and 360 cm. The relative microbial stabilization of rhizodeposits in the subsoil across all species showed a dominance of recently assimilated C in microbial necromass, thus indicating a higher microbial stabilization of rhizodeposited C with depth. In conclusion, we traced photosynthates down to 3.6 m soil depth and showed that even relatively small C amounts allocated to deep soil layers will become microbially stabilized. Thus, deep-rooted crops, in particular lucerne are important for stabilization and storage of C over long time scales in deep soil.},

@article{Harmon2020,
abstract = {Background: Recent increases in forest tree mortality should increase the abundance coarse woody detritus (CWD) and ultimately lead to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, the time course of carbon release from CWD is not well understood. We compiled CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k) to examine how tree species, piece diameter, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and macroclimate influenced k. To illustrate their implications we modeled the effect of species and position on estimates of decomposition-related carbon flux. We examined a subset of currently used models to determine if their structure accounted for these factors. Results: Globally k of downed CWD varied at least 244-fold with interspecies variation at individual sites up to 76-fold. While k generally decreased with increasing piece diameter, under open canopies the opposite occurred. Standing CWD sometimes exhibited little decomposition, but sometimes had k values up to 3 times faster than downed CWD. There was a clear response of k to mean annual temperature of ≈ 2.6 times per 10 °C; however, there was considerable variation for a given mean annual temperature related to species, diameter, and position. A key feature of carbon release from CWD after disturbance was the "evolution" of the ecosystem-level k value as positions and species mixtures of the remaining CWD changed. Variations in decomposition caused by disturbance (e.g., changes in species, positions, sizes, and microclimate) had the potential to cause net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere to be highly nonlinear. While several models currently being used for carbon accounting and assessing land-use/climate change would potentially capture some of these post disturbance changes in fluxes and carbon balances, many would not. Conclusions: While much has been learned in the last 5 decades about CWD decomposition, to fully understand the time course of carbon release from increased mortality and other aspects of global change a new phase of global CWD research that is more systematic, experimental, and replicated needs to be initiated. If our findings are to be fully applied in modeling, an approach acknowledging how the rate of carbon release evolves over time should be implemented.},

abstract = {Game damage to agriculture represents one of the most important and most frequent human-wildlife conflicts worldwide. In Hungary and in the other European countries, damage caused by wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) is the most significant. The volume of damage is correlated with the population density of the game species, however, not exclusively. Since the growing expansion of wild ungulates is a general tendency in Europe, increasing conflicts can be envisaged. The objective of our study was to assess the possible relationships between the amount of agricultural game damage and big game population density considering some other factors (e. g. habitat structure, sown area of cultivated plants) by analysing wildlife management and land-use statistics for the 19 counties of Hungary from 1997 to 2008. According to the results, crop damage positively correlated with the population density of red deer and wild boar, with the length of forest edge, and the proportion of the sown area of maize. According to the regression model, these factors could be accountable for 74. 2 % of the total agricultural game damage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a, Poland.},

abstract = {Among the numerous sources of greenhouse gases, emissions of CO2 are considerably affected by changes in the extent and type of land use, e.g., intensive agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, soil erosion, or wetland drainage. As a feasible option to control emissions from the terrestrial ecosystems, the scientific community has explored the possibility of enhancing soil carbon (C) storage capacity. Thus, restoration of damaged lands through conservation tillage, crop rotation, cover cropping, reforestation, sub-soiling of compacted lands, sustainable water management practices, and organic manuring are the major antidotes against attenuation of soil organic C (SOC) stocks. In this research, we focused on the effect of various man-made activities on soil biotic organics (e.g., green-, farm-yard manure, and composts) to understand how C fluxes from various sources contribute to the establishment of a new equilibrium in the terrestrial ecosystems. Although such inputs substitute a portion of chemical fertilizers, they all undergo activities that augment the rate and extent of decay to deplete the SOC bank. Here, we provide perspectives on the balancing factors that control the mineralization rate of organic matter. Our arguments are placed in the background of different land use types and their impacts on forests, agriculture, urbanization, soil erosion, and wetland destruction.},

In the process of wetting the soil, water molecules displace the adsorbed O2 and N2 molecules to the gas phase where they can be measured, as was done in this study. These gases, released from the adsorbed phase, join entrapped air in the gaseous phase as the primary factor disintegrating aggregates when soils are wet quickly. Adsorption of N2 and O2 occurs on surface soils during hot dry afternoons as the water molecules leave the surface. During cool nights, relative humidities commonly rise above 50%, allowing more strongly adsorbed H2O molecules to displace adsorbed O2 and N2. Release of this adsorbed N2 and O2 causes aggregates wetted by immersion during hot afternoons to be less stable},

A practical test concerning the reproducibility of chemical shift information from recorded 13C NMR spectra was carried out using eight test substances. Two hundred seventy spectra were contributed from both Academia and Industry and have been subjected to a standardized interpretation. For these spectra the confidence limits of their chemical shifts have been calculated. The standard deviations found vary from 0.2 up to about 2.5 ppm, and the range of values for the shifts reported vary from ±0.7 up to more than ±7 ppm around the respective average shift. Test substances recorded in more polar solvents generally showed higher standard deviations and also exhibit a dependency of the deviation on the chemical shift value.},

abstract = {Through litter decomposition enormous amounts of carbon is emitted to the atmosphere. Numerous large-scale decomposition experiments have been conducted focusing on this fundamental soil process in order to understand the controls on the terrestrial carbon transfer to the atmosphere. However, previous studies were mostly based on site-specific litter and methodologies, adding major uncertainty to syntheses, comparisons and meta-analyses across different experiments and sites. In the TeaComposition initiative, the potential litter decomposition is investigated by using standardized substrates (Rooibos and Green tea) for comparison of litter mass loss at 336 sites (ranging from −9 to +26 °C MAT and from 60 to 3113 mm MAP) across different ecosystems. In this study we tested the effect of climate (temperature and moisture), litter type and land-use on early stage decomposition (3 months) across nine biomes. We show that litter quality was the predominant controlling factor in early stage litter decomposition, which explained about 65% of the variability in litter decomposition at a global scale. The effect of climate, on the other hand, was not litter specific and explained <0.5% of the variation for Green tea and 5% for Rooibos tea, and was of significance only under unfavorable decomposition conditions (i.e. xeric versus mesic environments). When the data were aggregated at the biome scale, climate played a significant role on decomposition of both litter types (explaining 64% of the variation for Green tea and 72% for Rooibos tea). No significant effect of land-use on early stage litter decomposition was noted within the temperate biome. Our results indicate that multiple drivers are affecting early stage litter mass loss with litter quality being dominant. In order to be able to quantify the relative importance of the different drivers over time, long-term studies combined with experimental trials are needed.},

Here, we introduce the theory as applied to the puzzle of nonforested (open) biomes growing in climates that are warm and wet enough to support forests (alternative biome states, ABSs). Long thought to be the product of deforestation, diverse lines of evidence indicate that many open ecosystems are ancient. They have also been characterized as ‘early successional' even where they persist for millennia. ABS is an alternative framework to that of climate determinism and succession for exploring forest/nonforest mosaics. This framework explains not only tropical forest–savanna landscapes, but also other landscape mosaics across the globe.},

abstract = {The present and future concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide depends on both anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks of carbon. Most proposed climate mitigation strategies rely on a progressive transition to carbon-efficient technologies to reduce industrial emissions, substantially supported by policies to maintain or enhance the terrestrial carbon stock in forests and other ecosystems. This strategy may be challenged if terrestrial sequestration capacity is affected by future climate feedbacks, but how and to what extent is little understood. Here, we show that climate mitigation strategies are highly sensitive to future natural disturbance rates (e.g. fires, hurricanes, droughts), because of the potential effect of disturbances on the terrestrial carbon balance. Generally, altered disturbance rates affect the pace of societal and technological transitions required to achieve the mitigation target, with substantial consequences on the energy sector and the global economy. An understanding of the future dynamics and consequences of natural disturbances on terrestrial carbon balance is thus essential for developing robust climate mitigation strategies and policies.},

abstract = {Factors affecting the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of the gas-phase S(N)2 reactions and their temperature dependence have been analyzed using the ion-molecule collision theory and the transition state theory (TST). The quantum-mechanical tunneling effects were also considered using the canonical variational theory with small curvature tunneling (CVT/SCT). We have benchmarked a few ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) methods for their performance in predicting the deuterium KIEs against eleven experimental values. The results showed that the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ method gave the most accurate prediction overall. The slight inverse deuterium KIEs usually observed for the gas-phase S(N)2 reactions at room temperature were due to the balance of the normal rotational contribution and the significant inverse vibrational contribution. Since the vibrational contribution is a sensitive function of temperature while the rotation contribution is temperature independent, the KIEs are thus also temperature dependent. For S(N)2 reactions with appreciable barrier heights, the tunneling effects were predicted to contribute significantly both to the rate constants and to the carbon-13, and carbon-14 KIEs, which suggested important carbon atom tunneling at and below room temperature.},

@article{Guenet2016,
abstract = {Priming of soil carbon decomposition encompasses different processes through which the decomposition of native (already present) soil organic matter is amplified through the addition of new organic matter, with new inputs typically being more labile than the native soil organic matter. Evidence for priming comes from laboratory and field experiments, but to date there is no estimate of its impact at global scale and under the current anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle. Current soil carbon decomposition models do not include priming mechanisms, thereby introducing uncertainty when extrapolating short-term local observations to ecosystem and regional to global scale. In this study we present a simple conceptual model of decomposition priming, called PRIM, able to reproduce laboratory (incubation) and field (litter manipulation) priming experiments. Parameters for this model were first optimized against data from 20 soil incubation experiments using a Bayesian framework. The optimized parameter values were evaluated against another set of soil incubation data independent from the ones used for calibration and the PRIM model reproduced the soil incubations data better than the original, CENTURY-type soil decomposition model, whose decomposition equations are based only on first order kinetics. We then compared the PRIM model and the standard first order decay model incorporated into the global land biosphere model ORCHIDEE. A test of both models was performed at ecosystem scale using litter manipulation experiments from 5 sites. Although both versions were equally able to reproduce observed decay rates of litter, only ORCHIDEE-PRIM could simulate the observed priming (R2 = 0.54) in cases where litter was added or removed. This result suggests that a conceptually simple and numerically tractable representation of priming adapted to global models is able to capture the sign and magnitude of the priming of litter and soil organic matter.},

@article{Bellon-Maurel2011a,
abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Sommer2014,
abstract = {When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014-2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9-3.9% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032-33, at that time reaching 4.3-8.9% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Briscoe2011,
abstract = {In this paper we propose that the conventional dichotomy between exemplar-based and prototype-based models of concept learning is helpfully viewed as an instance of what is known in the statistical learning literature as the bias/variance tradeoff. The bias/variance tradeoff can be thought of as a sliding scale that modulates how closely any learning procedure adheres to its training data. At one end of the scale (high variance), models can entertain very complex hypotheses, allowing them to fit a wide variety of data very closely--but as a result can generalize poorly, a phenomenon called overfitting. At the other end of the scale (high bias), models make relatively simple and inflexible assumptions, and as a result may fit the data poorly, called underfitting. Exemplar and prototype models of category formation are at opposite ends of this scale: prototype models are highly biased, in that they assume a simple, standard conceptual form (the prototype), while exemplar models have very little bias but high variance, allowing them to fit virtually any combination of training data. We investigated human learners' position on this spectrum by confronting them with category structures at variable levels of intrinsic complexity, ranging from simple prototype-like categories to much more complex multimodal ones. The results show that human learners adopt an intermediate point on the bias/variance continuum, inconsistent with either of the poles occupied by most conventional approaches. We present a simple model that adjusts (regularizes) the complexity of its hypotheses in order to suit the training data, which fits the experimental data better than representative exemplar and prototype models.},

abstract = {This study focused on tree mortality in spruce-dominated stands managed using the single-tree selection method in southern Finland. Together with regeneration and tree growth, mortality is one of the basic elements of the stand structure and dynamics in selection stands. The study was based on data acquired from a set of 20 permanent experimental plots monitored with repeated measurements for 20 years. The average mortality in the number of stems (N) was 4.45 trees ha−1a−1, in basal area (G) 0.07 m2 ha−1a−1, and in stemwood volume (V) 0.56 m3 ha−1a−1. In relative terms it was 0.50% of N, 0.30% of G and 0.27% of V, respectively. Wind and snow were the most common causes of mortality, while deaths by biotic causes (mammals, insects, pathogens) were extremely rare. Some 6–10% of the total loss in the number of stems and volume was attributable to the loss or removal of trees that sustained serious damage in harvesting. Most of the mortality occurred in the smallest diameter classes of up to 20 cm. Such a high mortality among small trees can have an adverse influence on the sustainability of selection structures if not successfully checked in harvesting and management.},

abstract = {Forests soils should be neither sinks nor sources of carbon in a long-term perspective. From a Swedish perspective the time since the last glaciation has probably not been long enough to reach a steady state, although changes are currently very slow. In a shorter perspective, climatic and management changes over the past 100 years have probably created imbalances between litter input to soils and organic carbon mineralisation. Using extant data on forest inventories, we applied models to analyse possible changes in the carbon stocks of Swedish forest soils. The models use tree stocks to provide estimates of tree litter production, which are fed to models of litter decomposition and from which carbon stocks are calculated. National soil carbon stocks were estimated to have increased by 3 Tg yr-1 or 12-13 g m-2 yr -1 in the period 1926-2000 and this increase will continue because soil stocks are far from equilibrium with current litter inputs. The figure obtained is likely to be an underestimation because wet sites store more carbon than predicted here and the inhibitory effect of nitrogen deposition on soil carbon mineralisation was neglected. Knowledge about site history prior to the calculation period determines the accuracy of current soil carbon stocks estimates, although changes can be more accurately estimated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Forests dominate carbon (C) exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere on land. In the long term, the net carbon flux between forests and the atmosphere has been significantly impacted by changes in forest cover area and structure due to ecological disturbances and management activities. Current empirical approaches for estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) rarely consider forest age as a predictor, which represents variation in physiological processes that can respond differently to environmental drivers, and regrowth following disturbance. Here, we conduct an observational synthesis to empirically determine to what extent climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, forest age and management influence the spatial and interannual variability of forest NEP across 126 forest eddy-covariance flux sites worldwide. The empirical models explained up to 62% and 71% of spatio-temporal and across-site variability of annual NEP, respectively. An investigation of model structures revealed that forest age was adominant factor of NEP spatio-temporal variability in both space and time at the global scale as compared to abiotic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil characteristics and climate. These findings emphasize the importance of forest age in quantifying spatio-temporal variation in NEP using empirical approaches.},

abstract = {Forests are critical habitats for biodiversity and they are also essential for the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services that are important to human well-being. There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Root length and fresh weight increased rapidly for 80 days following planting, remained relatively constant for 14 days, and then decreased rapidly when the plants were in the reproductive stage. A maximum root density of 4.1 cm/cm3 occurred in the O to 15 cm zone at 79 days. The lower soil zones reached maximum root density 1 to 2 weeks later than in the O to 15 cm zone. Root density in the O to 15 cm zone was greater in cores taken midway between plants in the row than at other locations. Maximum root length was 153 cm/cm2 of surface area at 86 days.},

abstract = {Soil respiration is the primary path by which CO2 fixed by land plants returns to the atmosphere. Estimated at approximately 75 × 1015 gC/yr, this large natural flux is likely to increase due to changes in the Earth's condition. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief scientific review for policymakers who are concerned that changes in soil respiration may contribute to the rise in CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase the flux of CO2 from soils, while simultaneously leaving a greater store of carbon in the soil. Traditional tillage cultivation and rising temperature increase the flux of CO2 from soils without increasing the stock of soil organic matter. Increasing deposi- tion of nitrogen from the atmosphere may lead to the sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils. The response of the land biosphere to simultaneous changes in all of these factors is unknown, but a large increase in the soil carbon pool seems unlikely to moderate the rise in atmospheric CO2 during the next century.

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Soil carbon (C) saturation behavior predicts that soil C storage efficiency observed under field conditions decreases as a soil approaches C saturation. This may be due to a decline in soil organic matter (SOM) stability as the result of changes in the type, strength or turnover time of organo-mineral interactions with increasing organic C input. The goal of this study was to test whether the stability of organic matter bound to soil minerals decreases as organo-mineral complexes approach C saturation with increasing C loading. A series of batch sorption experiments with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil mineral components was conducted to obtain organo-mineral complexes with a range of organic C loadings. The relative stability of C in these organo-mineral complexes was subsequently assessed using evolved CO2 gas analysis during thermal analyses and laboratory incubations. Results indicated that differences in dissolved organic C before and after sorption overestimated the amount of sorbed C when compared to differences in solid-phase C concentrations. Values of C/N, ??13C, and ??15N of the organo-mineral complexes were significantly smaller or more negative than initial soil samples or the stock DOM solution, consistent with the concept of molecular fractionation by sorption to minerals and suggesting that the composition of the organic matter in the organo-mineral complexes may have changed as the amount of sorbed organic matter increased. Observations that organic C loadings at maximum sorption did not substantially exceed 1mgCm-2 and linear rather than asymptotic relations between sorbed C and initial DOM concentrations suggest that organo-mineral complexes may not have reached C saturation under the conditions in the batch sorption experiments of this study. The temperature at which half of the CO2 evolved during thermal analysis (i.e., CO2-T50) increased with increasing C loading, suggesting the sorbed C required greater energy input for combustion. Results of the laboratory incubations to determine relative biological stability of sorbed C were not consistent with the initial hypothesis. The size of potentially mineralizable C pool relative to the total sorbed C decreased with increasing C loading, even though this pool was being degraded more rapidly. Overall, the results did not support the hypothesis that SOM stability decreases with increasing C loading. In spite of generating a wide range of C loadings substantially greater than previous studies, the conditions of the DOM sorption experiments conducted in this study appeared unable to generate organo-mineral complexes exhibiting C saturation behavior. We speculate that measurable decreases in SOM stability may occur only once the threshold of C saturation is reached. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Root architecture is an important regulator of nitrogen (N) acquisition. Existing methods to phenotype the root archi- tecture of cereal crops are generally limited to seedlings or to the outer roots of mature root crowns. The functional integration of root phenes is poorly understood. In this study, intensive phenotyping of mature root crowns of maize was conducted to discover phenes and phene modules related to N acquisition. Twelve maize genotypes were grown under replete and deficient N regimes in the field in South Africa and eight in the USA. An image was captured for every whorl of nodal roots in each crown. Custom software was used to measure root phenes including nodal occupancy, angle, diameter, distance to branching, lateral branching, and lateral length. Variation existed for all root phenes within maize root crowns. Size-related phenes such as diameter and number were substantially influenced by nodal position, while angle, lateral density, and distance to branching were not. Greater distance to branching, the length from the shoot to the emergence of laterals, is proposed to be a novel phene state that minimizes placing roots in already explored soil. Root phenes from both older and younger whorls of nodal roots contributed to variation in shoot mass and N uptake. The additive integration of root phenes accounted for 70% of the variation observed in shoot mass in low N soil. These results demonstrate the utility of intensive phenotyping of mature root systems, as well as the importance of phene integration in soil resource acquisition.},

Two contrasting management regimes are considered: optimal joint management of the two species and management where the decision maker is ignorant about interspecific competition. Results from our case study show that the presence of interspecific competition reduces roe deer population size and harvest by 30% and 47%, respectively, and reduces the net present value by 9%. High interspecific competition could lead to the exclusion of the roe deer from the area. In contrast, ignorance about the level and consequences of interspecific competition has no impact on harvest decisions and revenues. The explanation is the higher hunting benefits for fallow deer.},

abstract = {We present a method to visually score 10 root architectural traits of the root crown of an adult maize plant in the field in a few minutes. Phenotypic profiling of three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of maize (Zea mays L.; B73xMo17, Oh43xW64a, Ny821xH99) was conducted in 2008 in a silt loam soil in Pennsylvania and in a sandy soil in Wisconsin, and again in 2009 in Pennsylvania. Numbers, angles and branching pattern of crown and brace roots were assessed visually at flowering. Depending on the soil type in which plants were grown, sample processing took from three (sand) to 8 min (silt-loam). Visual measurement of the root crown required 2 min per sample irrespective of the environment. Visual scoring of root crowns gave a reliable estimation of values for root architectural traits as indicated by high correlations between measured and visually scored trait values for numbers (r2=0.46–0.97), angles (r2=0.66–0.76), and branch- ing (r2=0.54–0.88) of brace and crown roots. Based on the visual evaluation of root crown traits it was possible to discriminate between populations. RILs derived from the cross NY821 x H99 generally had the greatest number of roots, the highest branching density and the most shallow root angles, while inbred lines from the cross between OH43 x W64a generally had the steepest root angles. The ranking of genotypes remained the same across environments, emphasizing the suitability of the method to evaluate genotypes across environments. Scoring of brace roots was better correlated with the actual measure- ments compared to crown roots. The visual evaluation of root architecture will be a valuable tool in tailoring crop root systems to specific environments},

abstract = {Current estimates of soil C storage potential are based on models or factors that assume linearity between C input levels and C stocks at steady-state, implying that SOC stocks could increase without limit as C input levels increase. However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing C input levels suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C input levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C input levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The carbon (C) stocks of drylands, particularly in Africa, have become considerably depleted through land degradation leading to loss of soil fertility and water retention. Increasing tree cover is considered a practical means of increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. However, few field studies have been carried out in the eastern part of the Sahel zone to test this hypothesis. In this study the C stocks in biomass and soil were determined in Acacia senegal plantations of varying age (7-24 years) and adjacent open grasslands in two locations in Sudan. The contribution of C3 plants to SOC was estimated using a simple $\delta$13C partitioning model. Total biomass C stocks increased with plantation age, reaching 1020 g m-2. While most of this increase was due to the trees, the C stock of the ground vegetation also increased with plantation age and was greater in the oldest plantations than in the open grassland. This finding supports the hypothesis that trees facilitate ground vegetation in semi-arid environments. Plantation SOC stocks (0-50 cm) ranged from 846 to 1250 g m-2, increased with age and were greater than open grassland values (867-950 g m-2). The contribution of C3 plants (trees and herbs) to plantation under canopies SOC stocks (0-10 cm) was 47.2% and 53.4% at the two sites. SOC sequestration rates up to 19 g C m-2 yr-1 were achieved in the oldest plantations at one of the sites. Our findings indicate that planting trees in drylands could considerably increase SOC stocks and efforts to plant Acacia trees in the Sahel should therefore be encouraged.},

abstract = {In contrast to previous peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) model sensitivity analyses, which usually focussed on only one or a few processes, this study investigates interactions between various biotic and abiotic processes and their parameters by comparing CoupModel v5 results with multiple observation variables. Many interactions were found not only within but also between various process categories simulating plant growth, decomposition, radiation interception, soil temperature, aerodynamic resistance, transpiration, soil hydrology and snow. Each measurement variable was sensitive to up to 10 (out of 54) parameters, from up to 7 different process categories. The constrained parameter ranges varied, depending on the variable and performance index chosen as criteria, and on other calibrated parameters (equifinalities). Therefore, transferring parameter ranges between models needs to be done with caution, especially if such ranges were achieved by only considering a few processes. The identified interactions and constrained parameters will be of great interest to use for comparisons with model results and data from similar ecosystems. All of the available measurement variables (net ecosystem exchange, leaf area index, sensible and latent heat fluxes, net radiation, soil temperatures, water table depth and snow depth) improved the model constraint. If hydraulic properties or water content were measured, further parameters could be constrained, resolving several equifinalities and reducing model uncertainty. The presented results highlight the importance of considering biotic and abiotic processes together and can help modellers and experimentalists to design and calibrate models as well as to direct experimental set-ups in peatland ecosystems towards modelling needs.},

abstract = {Bioenergy from boreal forests managed for productive purposes (e.g., pulp, timber) is commonly held to offer attractive options for climate change mitigation. However, this view has been challenged in recent years. Carbon balances, cumulative radiative forcing, and average global temperature change have been calculated for a variety of bioenergy management regimes in Swedish forests, and the results support the view that an increased use of forest biomass for energy in Sweden can contribute to climate change mitigation, although methodological (e.g., spatial scales) and parameter value choices influence the results significantly. We show that the climate effect of forest-based bioenergy depends on the forest ecosystems and management, including biomass extraction for bioenergy and other products, and how this management changes in response to anticipated market demands; and on the energy system effects, which determine the fossil carbon displacement and other greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation effects of using forest biomass for bioenergy and other purposes. The public and private sectors are advised to consider information from comprehensive analyses that provide insights about energy and forest systems in the context of evolving forest product markets, alternative policy options, and energy technology pathways in their decision-making processes.},

abstract = {The methods used for estimating below-ground carbon (C) translocation by plants, and the results obtained for different plant species are reviewed. Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify root-derived C are discussed: pulse labeling, continuous labeling, and a method based on the difference in 13C natural abundance in C3 and C4 plants. It is shown, that only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole below-ground C translocation. This included roots, exudates and other organic substances, quickly decomposable by soil microorganisms, and CO2 produced by root respiration. Advantages due to coupling of two different tracer techniques are shown. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between plant species (cereals, grasses, and trees) are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20%-30% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in CO2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of rootborne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter. The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30%-50% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1500 kg C ha-1), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1500 and 2200kg C ha-1, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived CO2 efflux from the soil.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Forest harvest operations often produce large amounts of harvest residue which typically becomes fine (foliage, small limbs and trees) and coarse woody debris (snags and downed logs). If removed at harvest, residual biomass has potential to be a local energy source and to produce marketable biofuel feedstock. But, CWD in particular serves critical life-history functions (e.g., breeding, foraging, basking) for a variety of organisms. Unfortunately, little is known about how forest biodiversity would respond to large scale removal of harvest residues. We calculated 745 biodiversity effect sizes from 26 studies involving manipulations of CWD (i.e., removed or added downed woody debris and/or snags). Diversity and abundance of both cavity- and open-nesting birds were substantially and consistently lower in treatments with lower amounts of downed CWD and/or standing snags, as was biomass of invertebrates. However, cumulative effect sizes for other taxa were not as large, were based on fewer studies, and varied among manipulation types. Little is currently known about biodiversity response to harvest of fine woody debris. Predicting the effects of biomass harvests on forest biodiversity is uncertain at best until more is known about how operational harvests actually change fine and coarse woody debris levels over long time periods. Pilot biomass harvests report post-harvest changes in CWD levels much smaller than the experimental changes involved in the studies we analyzed. Thus, operational biomass harvests may not change CWD levels enough to appreciably influence forest biodiversity, especially when following biomass harvest guidelines that require leaving a portion of harvest residues. Multi-scale studies can help reduce this uncertainty by investigating how biodiversity responses scale from the small scale of manipulative experiments (i.e., 10-ha plots) to operational forest management and how biodiversity response to CWD levels might vary at different spatial and temporal scales and in different landscape contexts. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract = {In the last 80 years, a number of mathematical models of different level of complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in soils, spanning spatial scales from few $\mu$m to thousands of km and temporal scales from hours to centuries. Most of these models are based on kinetic and stoichiometric laws that constrain elemental cycling within the soil and the nutrient and carbon exchange with vegetation and the atmosphere. While biogeochemical model performance has been previously assessed in other reviews, less attention has been devoted to the mathematical features of the models, and how these are related to spatial and temporal scales. In this review, we consider ∼250 biogeochemical models, highlighting similarities in their theoretical frameworks and illustrating how their mathematical structure and formulation are related to the spatial and temporal scales of the model applications. Our analysis shows that similar kinetic and stoichiometric laws, formulated to mechanistically represent the complex underlying biochemical constraints, are common to most models, providing a basis for their classification. Moreover, a historic analysis reveals that the complexity and degree and number of nonlinearities generally increased with date, while they decreased with increasing spatial and temporal scale of interest. We also found that mathematical formulations specifically developed for certain scales (e.g., first order decay rates assumed in yearly time scale decomposition models) often tend to be used also at other spatial and temporal scales different from the original ones, possibly resulting in inconsistencies between theoretical formulations and model application. It is thus critical that future modeling efforts carefully account for the scale-dependence of their mathematical formulations, especially when applied to a wide range of scales. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A population of 110 adult fallow deer kept in an enclosure under very intensive conditions (31.4 deer/ha) was observed for 12 h/d (from 0800 to 2000) for 17 d during the birth season in order to study social and feeding behavior under intensive management. Observations were carried out by a scan sampling technique. The feeding activity of all the deer that were not hidden behind trees or other obstacles in the enclosure (60 to 90% of all deer) and the composition and position of all groups were recorded every 20 min by videocamera. Adult females ate more pasture than adult males, whereas adult males ate more hay and meal than females (P < .001). Feeding activity was concentrated in the morning and in the evening, but it was higher for bucks in the morning (when supplementary feed was distributed) than in the midday and in the evening (P < .001). The area where hay and meal were supplied was more frequently attended in morning by small groups of males. Group size was affected by the time of day (P < .05), being larger in the evening (13.6 +/- 1.2 in the evening vs 9.8 +/- 1.0 in the morning and 11.9 +/- 0.9 in the afternoon), when groups of females with fawns and mixed-sex groups (including at least one male) gathered into the pasture areas for grazing. Our study suggests that even under very intensive conditions fallow deer may tend to maintain the sexual segregation typical of this species during the birth season, but mixed-sex groups are still the most common type of social aggregation. This situation was particularly evident in the areas and at the time in which feeding activity was higher and might indicate that feeding requirements are more important than social needs when the space available is limited.},

abstract = {We present studies of 9 modern (up to 400-yr-old) peat sections from Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Finland. Precise radiocarbon dating of modern samples is possible due to the large bomb peak of atmospheric 14 C concentra-tion in 1963 and the following rapid decline in the 14 C level. All the analyzed 14 C profiles appeared concordant with the shape of the bomb peak of atmospheric 14 C concentration, integrated over some time interval with a length specific to the peat section. In the peat layers covered by the bomb peak, calendar ages of individual peat samples could be determined almost immediately, with an accuracy of 2–3 yr. In the pre-bomb sections, the calendar ages of individual dated samples are deter-mined in the form of multi-modal probability distributions of about 300 yr wide (about AD 1650–1950). However, simulta-neous use of the post-bomb and pre-bomb 14 C dates, and lithological information, enabled the rejection of most modes of probability distributions in the pre-bomb section. In effect, precise age-depth models of the post-bomb sections have been extended back in time, into the " wiggly " part of the 14 C calibration curve. Our study has demonstrated that where annual resolution is concerned, tissues of Sphagnum are the only representative mate-rial for 14 C dating, although even samples of pure Sphagnum collected from a very thin slice of the peat section contain tissues grown in different years, so they integrate the atmospheric 14 C signal over a period of time. This time period (0.5–8 yr, depend-ing on the site) seems to correlate with the peat accumulation rate, but it also depends on how the sampled peat sections were handled. When constructing age-depth models, for some peat sections we used the strategy of multi-stage 14 C dating. This led to a drastic reduction in the uncertainty of the age-depth models, by dating only a few additional samples in the profile. Our study is the first in which peat sections from the late pre-bomb time (AD 1900–1960) have been precisely dated at a high temporal resolution. In this time interval, 14 C ages of all the samples dated were younger than those derived from the atmo-spheric calibration curve, apparently due to the effect of integration. Evidently, the determination of calendar ages based on 14 C dating of single peat samples from that interval may be affected by a serious error if the possibility of integration is ignored.},

abstract = {Use of bioenergy can contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions and increased energy security. However, even though biomass is a renewable resource, the potential is limited, and efficient use of available biomass resources will become increasingly important. This paper aims to explore system interactions related to future bioenergy utilization and cost-efficient bioenergy technology choices under stringent CO2 constraints. In particular, the study investigates system effects linked to integration of advanced biofuel production with district heating and industry under different developments in the electricity sector and biomass supply system. The study is based on analysis with the MARKAL_Sweden model, which is a bottom-up, cost-optimization model covering the Swedish energy system. A time horizon to 2050 is applied. The results suggest that system integration of biofuel production has noteworthy effects on the overall system level, improves system cost-efficiency and influences parameters such as biomass price, marginal CO2 emission reduction costs and cost-efficient biofuel choices in the transport sector. In the long run and under stringent CO2 constraints, system integration of biofuel production has, however, low impact on total bioenergy use, which is largely decided by supply-related constraints, and on total transport biofuel use, which to large extent is driven by demand.},

abstract = {Uneven-aged forest management is suggested to be a sustainable management alternative in boreal forests, but knowledge on applicable harvest intensities is very limited as majority of the studies has focused on even-aged management practices. The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10–30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8–16 m2 ha−1). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m−2 a−1 of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5–20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m3 ha−1 for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5–7 m3 ha−1 a−1) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80–120 m3 ha−1 was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40–60 m3 ha−1. The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices.},

A typical Orthic Luvisol was freed from organic carbon by thermal destruction at 600oC. Then the degradation and humification of 14C-labelled maize straw by defined microbial communities was analysed. To study the role of microbial diversity on the humification of plant material, microcosms containing sterilized soil were inoculated with a natural microbial community or with microbial consortia consisting of bacterial and fungal soil isolates. Within 6 weeks, 41 +- 4% of applied 14C-labelled maize straw was mineralized in the soil microcosms containing complex communities derived from a soil suspension, whilst the most efficient communities composed of soil isolates mineralized less than 35%. The humification products were analysed by solution state 13C-NMR-spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The analyses of humic acids extracts by solution state 13C-NMR-spectroscopy revealed no difference in the development of typical chemical functional groups for humic substances during incubation. However, the increase in specific molecular size fractions of the extracted humic acids occurred only after inoculation with complex communities, but not with defined isolates. While it seems to be true that redundancy in soil microbial communities contributes to the resilience of soils, specific soil functions may no longer be performed if a microbial community is harshly affected in its diversity or growth conditions.},

abstract = {Declining rates of soil respiration are reliably observed during long-term laboratory incubations. However, the cause of this decline is uncertain. We explored different controls on soil respiration to elucidate the drivers of respiration rate declines during long-term soil incubations. Following a long-term (707. day) incubation (30??C) of soils from two sites (a cultivated and a forested plot at Kellogg Biological Station, Hickory Corners, MI, USA), soils were significantly depleted of both soil carbon and microbial biomass. To test the ability of these carbon- and biomass-depleted ("incubation-depleted") soils to respire labile organic matter, we exposed soils to a second, 42. day incubation (30??C) with and without an addition of plant residues. We controlled for soil carbon and microbial biomass depletion by incubating field fresh ("fresh") soils with and without an amendment of wheat and corn residues. Although respiration was consistently higher in the fresh versus incubation-depleted soil (2 and 1.2 times higher in the fresh cultivated and fresh forested soil, respectively), the ability to respire substrate did not differ between the fresh and incubation-depleted soils. Further, at the completion of the 42. day incubation, levels of microbial biomass in the incubation-depleted soils remained unchanged, while levels of microbial biomass in the field-fresh soil declined to levels similar to that of the incubation-depleted soils. Extra-cellular enzyme pools in the incubation-depleted soils were sometimes slightly reduced and did not respond to addition of labile substrate and did not limit soil respiration. Our results support the idea that available soil organic matter, rather than a lack microbial biomass and extracellular enzymes, limits soil respiration over the course of long-term incubations. That decomposition of both wheat and corn straw residues did not change after major changes in the soil biomass during extended incubation supports the omission of biomass values from biogeochemical models.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) added to soil as organic matter in crop residues and carbon emitted to the atmosphere as CO(2) in soil respiration are key determinants of the C balance in cropland ecosystems. We used complete and comprehensive county-level yields and area data to estimate and analyze the spatial and temporal variability of regional and national scale residue C inputs, net primary productivity (NPP), and C stocks in US croplands from 1982 to 1997. Annual residue C inputs were highest in the North Central and Central and Northern Plains regions that comprise similar to 70% of US cropland. Average residue C inputs ranged from 1.8 (Delta States) to 3.0 (North Central region) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), and average NPP ranged from 3.1 (Delta States) to 5.4 (Far West region) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Residue C inputs tended to be inversely proportional to the mean growing season temperature. A quadratic relationship incorporating the growing season mean temperature and total precipitation closely predicted the variation in residue C inputs in the North Central region and Central and Northern Plains. We analyzed the soil C balance using the crop residue database and the Introductory Carbon Balance regional Model (ICBMr). Soil C stocks (0-20 cm) on permanent cropland ranged between 3.07 and 3.1 Pg during the study period, with an average increase of similar to 4 Tg C year(-1), during the 1990s. Interannual variability in soil C stocks ranged from 0 to 20 Tg C (across a mean C stock of 3.08 +/- A 0.01 Pg) during the study period; interannual variability in residue C inputs varied between 1 and 43 Tg C (across a mean input of 220 +/- A 19 Tg). Such interannual variation has implications for national estimates of CO(2) emissions from cropland soils needed for implementation of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies involving agriculture.},

@article{Clymo1984,
abstract = {Not less than 2% of the Earth's land surface is peat-covered, so it is important to try to understand the dynamics of peat accumulation. Peat-forming systems (mires) accumulate peat because conditions within them impede the decay of the plant material produced by their surface vegetation. This paper concerns the rate of peat production and some unexpected consequences of the processes of decay. These consequences are likely to be of interest to those concerned with mire ecology and with the history of vegetation during Flandrian times. Most peat-forming systems consist of two layers: an upper 10-50 cm deep aerobic layer of high hydraulic conductivity, the acrotelm, in which the rate of decay is relatively high; and a thicker, usually anaerobic, lower layer, the catotelm, of low conductivity and with a much lower rate of decay. Plant structure at the base of the acrotelm collapses as a consequence of aerobic decay, and the hydraulic conductivity consequently decreases. As long as precipitation continues the water table therefore rises to this level, thus engulfing material at the base of the acrotelm. The rate, pc, of this input to the catotelm is exactly analogous to the rate, pa, of input to the acrotelm i.e. of primary productivity of the vegetation. During passage through the acrotelm the peat becomes richer in the more slowly decaying components. The depth of, and the time for transit through, the acrotelm thus control pc. The catotelm, however, usually forms much the largest part of the peat mass. Selective decay may continue in the catotelm. The specific composition of the peat thus becomes a progressively poorer indicator of the surface vegetation that formed it, and to a degree that is not generally realized: reconstructions of the past surface vegetation may become very inaccurate. If pc were constant and there were no decay in the catotelm then for the centre of a peat bog the profile of age against depth (measured as cumulative mass below the surface) would be a straight line. But if either or both these conditions is untrue then the profile would probably be concave. Most of the cases for which data exist are consistent with a concave profile and a value (constant over several thousand years) of pc of about 50 g m-2 a-1 and a decay rate coefficient, {\^{I}}±c, proportional to the amount of mass remaining, of about 10-4 a-1. This rate of input to the catotelm is about 10% of the primary productivity i.e. about 90% of the matter is lost during passage through the acrotelm. The relation seems to hold in spite of short-term fluctuations such as those represented by recurrence surfaces. Although 10-4 a-1 seems a very slow rate, it has important consequences. (i) The peat mass tends towards a steady state in which the rate of addition of matter at the surface, pa, is balanced by losses at all depths: the rate of accumulation is zero. This depth is, for the cases examined, about 5-10 m. (ii) The very concept of `peat accumulation rate' thus needs careful consideration. To calculate it as the difference between two 14C dates divided by the depth between the samples from which they were measured, as is commonly done, may be seriously misleading. The error is likely to increase with age, depth and time span. (iii) Progress in such studies can be made only if the easily measured profile of bulk density is known. The position of the profile in the peat bog must also be known. There is some evidence that peat contains, or comes to contain, about 1% or less of the original mass in a highly refractory state, so that the concept of a steady state is unlikely to be correct if times much greater than about 50 000 years are involved. Three more consequences of the continued very slow decay in the catotelm may be of interest to mire ecologists. (iv) Most of the mass that leaves the catotelm probably does so as methane gas. The concentration of methane increases with depth and may be as high as 5 {\^{I}}¼ mol cm-3 at 5 m depth (about 10% by volume). Diffusion alone is able to remove mass at the necessary rate and would create conce tration profiles similar to those observed. The solubility of methane in water is exceeded, however, and much of the methane may in practice be lost by mass flow of bubbles to the surface. (v) The amplitude of temperature fluctuations, as well as the mean temperature, may have a significant effect on the rate of peat decay, particularly in a cold climate. (vi) If this analysis is correct then the maximum depth of peat which can accumulate in 50 000 years is determined largely by the value of the quotient pc/{\^{I}}±c. The usual view that the maximum depth is determined directly by climate operating through hydrology may be incorrect, though hydrology may have an indirect effect on the value of pc, the rate of input to the catotelm at the bog centre. Away from the centre pc is probably variable p{\`{I}}ƒc and determined by hydrology. Its dependence on distance from the centre and on time is complicated: p{\`{I}}ƒc/pc may be more than, equal to, or less than 1.0. The age against depth profile away from the bog centre may be directly affected by hydrology, though the effect is not large except near the edge of the bog or near the base of the peat. There may, of course, be catastrophic failure -- a bog-burst or `flow'-- before the pc/{\^{I}}±c limit is reached in the centre, or slower but equally destructive development of gullies and erosion.},

abstract = {Termites are ubiquitous insects in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions and play an important role in ecosystems. Several termite species are also significant economic pests, mainly in urban areas where they attack human-made structures, but also in natural forest habitats. Worldwide, approximately 28 termite species are considered invasive and have spread beyond their native ranges, often with significant economic consequences. We used predictive climate modeling to provide the first global risk assessment for 13 of the world's most invasive termites. We modeled the future distribution of 13 of the most serious invasive termite species, using two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, and two projection years (2050 and 2070). Our results show that all but one termite species are expected to significantly increase in their global distribution, irrespective of the climatic scenario and year. The range shifts by species (shift vectors) revealed a complex pattern of distributional changes across latitudes rather than simple poleward expansion. Mapping of potential invasion hotspots in 2050 under the RCP 4.5 scenario revealed that the most suitable areas are located in the tropics. Substantial parts of all continents had suitable environmental conditions for more than four species simultaneously. Mapping of changes in the number of species revealed that areas that lose many species (e.g., parts of South America) are those that were previously very species-rich, contrary to regions such as Europe that were overall not among the most important invasion hotspots, but that showed a great increase in the number of potential invaders. The substantial economic and ecological damage caused by invasive termites is likely to increase in response to climate change, increased urbanization, and accelerating economic globalization, acting singly or interactively.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon measurements reveal that soil carbon is often hundreds to thousands of years old; significantly older than the annual flux of carbon through the soil would suggest. Models deal with this discrepancy by conceptualizing soil carbon as having fast and slow cycling pools. The Rothamsted Soil Carbon Model contains an inert pool for this reason. Here we use a unique record of time-series radiocarbon measurements from long-term trials to demonstrate that the inert pool is hardly inert, and that its mean age varies from 2000 to as little as 90 years depending on carbon flow through the soil. This finding suggests that the concept of truly inert organic matter requires redefinition to account for the enhanced probability that microorganisms will overcome barriers to previously inaccessible organic matter as their activity increases.},

Yet, research on litter decay and SOM formation has been largely uncoupled, failing to provide an effective nexus between these two fundamental processes for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and storage. We present the current understanding of the importance of microbial substrate use efficiency and C and N allocation in controlling the proportion of plant-derived C and N that is incorporated into SOM, and of soil matrix interactions in controlling SOM stabilization. We synthesize this understanding into the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework. This framework leads to the hypothesis that labile plant constituents are the dominant source of microbial products, relative to input rates, because they are utilized more efficiently by microbes. These microbial products of decomposition would thus become the main precursors of stable SOM by promoting aggregation and through strong chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix.},

Themeda triandra and Digitaria scalarum, dominant grass species of the area, were totally absent in the 1–10 m zone around the mound. The major species in the immediate vicinity of the mound were Pennisetum stramineum and Cynodon dactylon, the latter was a dominant species (over 90%) within the 0–10 m zone and entirely absent beyond 15 m from the mound. The number of grass species increased from 2–3 species around the mound to 6–7 species in the area apparently beyond the influence of the mound. High concentration of nutrients and favourable water availability, together with good drainage, appeared to be the major causes of increased biomass and different species composition of vegetation around the mound.},

abstract = {Although previously accepted as the less toxic alternative, with low impact on animals, farmers as well as consumers who are exposed to residues in food, glyphosate chemicals are now increasingly controversial as new evidence from research is emerging. We argue that specific aspects of the history, chemistry and safety of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides should be thoroughly considered in present and future re-evaluations of these dominant agrochemicals: {\textperiodcentered} Glyphosate is not a single chemical, it is a family of compounds with different chemical, physical and toxicological properties. {\textperiodcentered} Glyphosate is increasingly recognized as having more profound toxicological effects than assumed from previous assessments. {\textperiodcentered} Global use of glyphosate is continuously increasing and residues are detected in food, feed and drinking water. Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to higher levels of glyphosate residues, and from an increasing number of sources. {\textperiodcentered} Glyphosate regulation is predominantly still based on primary safety-assessment testing in various indicator organisms. However, archive studies indicate fraud and misbehavior committed by the commercial laboratories providing such research. We see emerging evidences from studies in test-animals, ecosystems indicators and studies in human health, which justify stricter regulatory measures. This implies revising glyphosate residue definitions and lowering Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) permissible in biological material intended for food and feed, as well as strengthening environmental criteria such as accepted residue concentrations in surface waters. It seems that although recent research indicates that glyphosates are less harmless than previously assumed and have complex toxicological potential, still regulatory authorities accept industry demands for approving higher levels of these residues in food and feed.},

Their decomposition is a key process of biogeochemical cycles in forest. Microorganisms are the primary agents of decomposition. Particularly, fungi are considered the major contributors due to their ability to produce specific enzymes and the possibility to access new substrates through hyphae. In this review, we highlighted the role of fungi in decomposition and reconsider the role of bacteria, neglected in the past, identifying key research needs and knowledge. Particular attention is given to the succession of different taxa with different ecological role that are able to use a substrate that undergoes to chemical and structural modifications. The quality of substrates is a critical factor that influences the microbial community together with environmental variables, such as temperature and moisture. However, the microbial community is also able to influence the substrate characteristics. Litter nitrogen content is influenced by the uptake of exogenous N by decomposers to meet their metabolic requirements. The complex interactions among microbial communities, ecosystem attributes and chemical composition of fine litter and woody debris remain unclear and almost exclusively referred to boreal and temperate forests.},

Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha-1. Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries.

abstract = {Amazonia has been recently included in discussions on the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle owing to extensive peatlands up to 7.5 m thick, reported from Western Amazonia (Peru). The aim of this study was to explore peat accumulation in Central Amazonia (Brazil). Of seven field sites, six located in the Negro River basin and one close to the junction of the Negro River with the Amazon, four had a peat deposit from 0.10 to 2.10 m thick. Another two sites had other organic soil type which could not be called peat. Only one site did not have any organic deposit. The loss-on-ignition (LOI), carbon content and dry bulk density, measured for the four peatland sites, varied from 17.7 to 97.4 %, 11 to 59 %, and 0.0002 to 0.572 g cm-3, respectively. All sites were classified as minerotrophic based on pH and peat thickness. The study confirms that Amazonian peatlands are not limited to Western Amazonia but also exist in Central Amazonia. We could not find as thick and extensive peats as in Western Amazonia, which we suggest is due to differences in rainfall and hydrology, tectonic conditions, topography, subsoil type and frequency of fires. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract = {<p>Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) is one of the cheapest and technically least demanding carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) removal (CDR) or negative CO<sub>2</sub> emission technologies. For a realistic assessment of SCS, it is critical to evaluate how much carbon (C) can be stored in soil organic matter under actual agricultural practices. This includes typical crop rotations and fertilization strategies, depends on resources that are available (e.g. farmyard manure (FYM)) and are affordable for farmers. Furthermore, it is important to assess SCS based on given climatic and soil conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in soil C storage for Switzerland using data from eleven long-term field experiments on cropland and permanent grassland that include common local practices.</p><p>At all sites, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were measured in topsoil (∼0-0.2 m) in response to a total of 80 different treatments including different types of mineral or organic fertilization (e.g. FYM, slurry, peat, compost) or soil management (tillage vs. no-till). The treatments were applied to different, diverse crop rotations or grass mixtures that are representative for Switzerland. We found that topsoils lost C at an average rate of 0.29 Mg C ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, although many of the investigated treatments were expected to lead to SOC increases. Based on a linear mixed effects model we showed that SOC change rates ($\Delta$SOC) were driven by C inputs to soil (harvest residues and organic fertilizer), soil cover and initial SOC stocks. The type of land use or soil tillage had no significant effect. Our analysis suggests that current efforts to manage soils sustainably need to be intensified and complemented with further techniques if Switzerland wants to achieve the goal of the 4 per 1000 initiative.</p>},

abstract = {Most heterotrophic organisms feed on substrates that are poor in nutrients compared to their demand, leading to elemental imbalances that may constrain their growth and function. Flexible carbon (C)-use efficiency (CUE, C used for growth over C taken up) can represent a strategy to reduce elemental imbalances. Here, we argue that metabolic regulation has evolved to maximise the organism growth rate along gradients of nutrient availability and translated this assumption into an optimality model that links CUE to substrate and organism stoichiometry. The optimal CUE is predicted to decrease with increasing substrate C-to-nutrient ratio, and increase with nutrient amendment. These predictions are generally confirmed by empirical evidence from a new database of c. 2200 CUE estimates, lending support to the hypothesis that CUE is optimised across levels of organisation (microorganisms and animals), in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and when considering nitrogen or phosphorus as limiting nutrients.},

abstract = {The mycorrhizal, rhizosphere and basal components of soil respiration were partitioned in a barley field experiment with the main objective of determining the controlling effects of photosynthetic activity and temperature on soil respiration sources. Micro-pore meshes were used to create both root and mycorrhiza-free soil cores over which collars for soil respiration measurements were inserted. Differences between mesh treatments were used to determine the contribution of each component. With a focus on the growing season, we analyzed the response of respiration sources to photosynthesis, temperature and moisture, as well as changes in microbial biomass, mineral nitrogen and carbon-nitrogen ratios responding to treatment and time of year. Results gave clear differences between sources in their response to both temperature and photosynthetic activity and showed that several processes are involved in determining respiration rates as well as apparent temperature relations. In particular, the respiration of arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae was seen to be a significant amount of root derived carbon respiration (25.3%) and consequently of total assimilated carbon (4.8%). This source showed a stronger response to photosynthetic activity than the rhizosphere component (r2=0.79, p<0.001 and r2=0.324, p=0.53, respectively). Q10 values-the increase in respiration rates with a 10 ??C increase in temperature-changed seasonally and showed temperature relations being dependent on the presence of mycorrhizal and rhizosphere respiration sources, as well as on plant development. Respiration from mycorrhizal hyphae and the rhizosphere showed no response (r2=0, p<0.99) or low response (r2=0.14, p<0.01) to temperature, respectively. We conclude that the potential importance and controls of mycorrhizal fungi respiration in croplands are comparable to those observed in other ecosystems, and that temperature response curves should be carefully interpreted given that substrate availability and plant dynamics strongly regulate respiration rates in ecosystems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterising the complex chemistry of soil organic carbon (SOC), but is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming and technically-demanding. Diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is an attractive alternative because it is a high-throughput, cost-effective and easy-to-use technique that provides information on the amount and nature of soil mineral and organic components. However, interpretation of complex MIR spectra can be challenging due to difficulties with distinguishing SOC peaks from overlapping mineral-related peaks. We present a novel approach to predict the entire NMR spectra of SOC from corresponding MIR spectra using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) in an R environment. We developed a multi-response MIR-PLSR prediction model by regressing corresponding NMR and MIR spectra of 99 HF-treated < 50. ??m fractions of soils using the pls package. The model was validated using (set-aside) test sets in four model iterations. The model provided accurate predictions of the entire average NMR spectra. Average Euclidean distance values between spectra in the training set were at least 3.5 fold greater than those between average reference and predicted NMR spectra, indicating that prediction errors were small relative to between-soil variation. Our approach accurately predicted intricate NMR spectra, demonstrating new potential for routine analysis of complex SOC chemistry.},

abstract = {Changes in the soil carbon stock of Finnish upland soils were quantified using forest inventory data, forest statistics, biomass models, litter turnover rates, and the Yasso07 soil model. Uncertainty in the estimated stock changes was assessed by combining model and sampling errors associated with the various data sources into variance–covariance matrices that allowed computationally efficient error propagation in the context of Yasso07 simulations. In sensitivity analysis, we found that the uncertainty increased drastically as a result of adding random year-to-year variation to the litter input. Such variation is smoothed out when using periodic inventory data with constant biomass models and turnover rates. Model errors (biomass, litter, understorey vegetation) and the systematic error of total drain had a marginal effect on the uncertainty regarding soil carbon stock change. Most of the uncertainty appears to be related to uncaptured annual variation in litter amounts. This is due to fact that variation in the slopes of litter input trends dictates the uncertainty of soil carbon stock change. If we assume that there is annual variation only in foliage and fine root litter rates and that this variation is less than 10% from year to year, then we can claim that Finnish upland forest soils have accumulated carbon during the first Kyoto period (2008–2012).

Several ways of reporting 14C activity levels relative to a standard were also established, but no specific instructions were given for reporting nuclear weapons-testing (post-bomb) 14C levels in samples. Because the use of post-bomb 14C is becoming more prevalent in forensics, biology, and geosciences, a convention needs to be adopted. We advocate the use of fraction modern with a new symbol F14C to prevent confusion with the previously used Fm, which may or may not have been fractionation-corrected. We also discuss the calibration of post-bomb 14C samples and the available data sets and compilations, but do not give a recommendation for a particular data set.},

To support our case, we engage with theories of the aesthetic and the spiritual, sample the discourse of ‘wilderness', and provide empirical evidence from the recent UK National Ecosystem Assessment Follow-on Phase. We observe that accounts of spiritual and aesthetic value in Western culture are diverse and expressed through different media. We recognise that humans do benefit from their aesthetic and spiritual experiences of nature. However, aesthetic and spiritual understandings of the value of nature lead people to develop moral responsibilities towards nature and these are more significant than aesthetic and spiritual benefits from nature. We conclude that aesthetic and spiritual values challenge economic conceptions of ecosystems and of value (including existence value), and that an analysis of cultural productions and a plural-values approach are needed to evidence them appropriately for decision-making.},

As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a model of forest soil organic matter based on the concept of succession stages of soil organic matter decomposition marked by different groups of soil fauna inherent to forest soils in contrast to well-mixed agricultural soils with microbiology kinetics. This model allows the calculation of the dynamics of soil organic matter and the corresponding dynamics of nitrogen, including the evaluation of the amount of mineral nitrogen which is available for plants. The input parameters are the amount and quality of litter input, climatic data and initial amounts of soil organic matter and corresponding nitrogen. The litter may be split into different cohorts which are characterised by different ash and nitrogen contents and location on/in a soil as above-ground and below-ground litter cohorts. A specially developed simulator of soil climate is also described. A comparison was made with a previous, more restricted version of this model. The origin of the differences is discussed in detail. Examples of simulation scenarios show a wide range of possible applications for the model as a separate unit of models for forest ecosystems dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The remarkable complexity of soil and its importance to a wide range of ecosystem services presents major challenges to the modeling of soil pro-cesses. Although major progress in soil models has occurred in the last decades, models of soil processes remain disjointed between disciplines or ecosystem services, with considerable uncertainty remaining in the qual-ity of predictions and several challenges that remain yet to be addressed. First, there is a need to improve exchange of knowledge and experience among the different disciplines in soil science and to reach out to other Earth science communities. Second, the community needs to develop a new generation of soil models based on a systemic approach comprising relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes to address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of soil processes and their interac-tions. Overcoming these challenges will facilitate exchanges between soil modeling and climate, plant, and social science modeling communi-ties. It will allow us to contribute to preserve and improve our assessment of ecosystem services and advance our understanding of climate-change feedback mechanisms, among others, thereby facilitating and strengthen-ing communication among scientific disciplines and society. We review the role of modeling soil processes in quantifying key soil processes that shape ecosystem services, with a focus on provisioning and regulating services. We then identify key challenges in modeling soil processes, including the systematic incorporation of heterogeneity and uncertainty, the integration of data and models, and strategies for effective integration of knowledge on physical, chemical, and biological soil processes. We discuss how the soil modeling community could best interface with modern modeling activities in other disciplines, such as climate, ecology, and plant research, and how to weave novel observation and measurement techniques into soil models. We propose the establishment of an international soil modeling consortium to coherently advance soil modeling activities and foster communication with other Earth science disciplines. Such a consortium should promote soil modeling platforms and data repository for model development, calibra-tion and intercomparison essential for addressing contemporary challenges.},

abstract = {Current attempts to explain the persistence of carbon in soils focuses on explanations such as the recalcitrant plant residues and the physical isolation of substrates from decomposers. A pool of organic matter that can persist for centuries to millennia is hypothesized because of the evidence provided by the persistence of pre-disturbance C in fallow or vegetation change experiments, and the radiocarbon age of soil carbon. However, new information, which became available through advances in the ability to measure the isotope signatures of specific compounds, favors a new picture of organic matter dynamics. Instead of persistence of plant-derived residues like lignin in the soil, the majority of mineral soil is in molecules derived from microbial synthesis. Carbon recycled multiple times through the microbial community can be old, decoupling the radio- carbon age of C atoms from the chemical or biological lability of the molecules they comprise. In consequence is soil microbiology, a major control on soil carbon dynamics, which highlights the potential vulnerability of soil organic matter to changing environmental condi- tions. Moreover, it emphasizes the need to devise new management options to restore, increase, and secure this valuable resource.},

abstract = {Mathematical models, such as the DNDC (DeNitrification DeComposition) model, are powerful tools that are increasingly being used to examine the potential impacts of management and climate change in agriculture. DNDC can simulate the processes responsible for production, consumption and transport of nitrous oxide (N2O). During the last 20 years DNDC has been modified and adapted by various research groups around the world to suit specific purposes and circumstances. In this paper we review the different versions of the DNDC model including models developed for different ecosystems, e.g. Forest-DNDC, Forest-DNDC-Tropica, regionalised for different areas of the world, e.g. NZ-DNDC, UK-DNDC, modified to suit specific crops, e.g. DNDC-Rice, DNDC-CSW or modularised e.g. Mobile-DNDC, Landscape-DNDC. A 'family tree' and chronological history of the DNDC model is presented, outlining the main features of each version. A literature search was conducted and a survey sent out to c. 1500 model users worldwide to obtain information on the use and development of DNDC. Survey results highlight the many strengths of DNDC including the comparative ease with which the DNDC model can be used and the attractiveness of the graphical user interface. Identified weaknesses could be rectified by providing a more comprehensive user manual, version control and increasing model transparency in collaboration with the Global Research Alliance Modelling Platform (GRAMP), which has much to offer the DNDC user community in terms of promoting the use of DNDC and addressing the deficiencies in the present arrangements for the models' stewardship.},

abstract = {Enzyme dynamics are being incorporated into soil carbon cycling models and accurate representation of enzyme kinetics is an important step in predicting belowground nutrient dynamics. A scarce number of studies have measured activation energy (Ea) in soils and fewer studies have measured Ea in arctic and tropical soils, or in subsurface soils. We determined the Ea for four typical lignocellulose degrading enzymes in the A and B horizons of seven soils covering six different soil orders. We also elucidated which soil properties predicted any measurable differences in Ea. $\beta$-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities were measured at five temperatures, 4, 21, 30, 40, and 60°C. Ea was calculated using the Arrhenius equation. $\beta$-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase Ea values for both A and B horizons in this study were similar to previously reported values, however we could not make a direct comparison for B horizon soils because of the lack of data. There was no consistent relationship between hydrolase enzyme Ea and the environmental variables we measured. Phenol oxidase was the only enzyme that had a consistent positive relationship between Ea and pH in both horizons. The Ea in the arctic and subarctic zones for peroxidase was lower than the hydrolases and phenol oxidase values, indicating peroxidase may be a rate limited enzyme in environments under warming conditions. By including these six soil types we have increased the number of soil oxidative enzyme Ea values reported in the literature by 50%. This study is a step towards better quantifying enzyme kinetics in different climate zones.},

abstract = {The methods used for estimating rhizodeposition of plants (carbon (C) deposition of living roots), and the results obtained for different plant species are reviewed. Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify rhizodeposition are discussed: pulse labelling, continuous labelling, and natural 13C abundance. Only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole rhizodeposition. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between cereals and grasses are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20 – 30% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one- third in CO2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of root-borne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter (SOM). The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30 –50% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1.5 Mg C ha71; calculated for the productivity of about 6 Mg grain yield), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1.5 and 2.2 Mg C ha71, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived CO2 efflux from the soil. Contribution of C4 carbon (from maize and some C4 grasses) to turnover of SOM (C3 soils) estimated by natural 13C abundance is reviewed. In average for Ap horizons, the portion of maize derived carbon increases of about 0.98% of SOM content per year. Factors influencing the contribution of maize-derived carbon to soil organic carbon are discussed. The contribution of maize derived carbon decreases with soil depth, without fertilization, after removal of above ground biomass, and with soil tillage.},

abstract = {Droughts are among the costliest natural disasters. They affect wide regions and large numbers of people worldwide by tampering with water availability and agricultural production. In this research, soil moisture drought trends are assessed for Europe using the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) estimated on Joint UK Land Environment Simulator simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways, the RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Results show that SMI drought conditions are expected to exacerbate in Europe with substantial differences among regions. Eastern Europe and Mediterranean regions are found to be the most affected. Spatially and temporally contiguous regions that exhibit SMI of Severe and Extreme index categories are identified as distinct drought events and are assessed for their characteristics. It is shown that even under strong emissions mitigation, these events are expected to increase in occurrence (22% to 123%), while their characteristics will become more unfavorable. Results indicate increase in their spatial extend (between 23% and 46%) and their duration (between 16% and 48%) depending on the period and the scenario. Additional analysis was performed for the exceptionally wide-area (over 106 km2) severe and extreme soil moisture drought events that are expected to drastically increase comparing to the recent past. Projections show that those events are expected to happen between 11 and 28 times more frequently depending on the scenario and the period with a 59% to 246% larger duration. These findings indicate that even applying strong mitigation measures, agricultural drought risk in Europe is expected to become higher than our present experience.},

abstract = {Peatlands are important chronological archives of paleoenvironmental changes, since they preserve materials which enable reconstruction of paleoenvironments from the Late Pleistocene. The Serra do Espinha{\c{c}}o Meridional (SdEM), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, can be considered one of the main areas of tropical mountain peatlands on Earth. When climate conditions are favorable, peatland formation occurs through the combination of lithology with relief and vegetation, whereby depressions favor the accumulation of water and nutrient poverty of quartzite lithologies induces the growth of vegetation rich in C metabolites and lignin. Anaerobiosis, together with organic matter resilience, low pH, and high Al3+ content, favor the successive accumulation of organic matter in time and space. The aim of this study is to correlate the age of basal organic matter of the SdEM peatlands with their altitudes and to identify the environmental factors that acted upon peatland formation. Eleven peatlands, situated between 1244 and 2014 m a.s.l., were identified using satellite imagery and cores were sampled in the field. Eighteen cores were collected from under grasslands and forest clusters in aluminum tubes of 8 cm in diameter. The basal layers, between 15 and 397 cm deep, had carbon content, average decomposition stage of organic matter, and radiocarbon age determined. Average carbon content increases and average decomposition stage of organic matter decreases with altitude. The peatlands situated below 1370 m a.s.l. would have begun to form in the Late Pleistocene, while those situated between 1580 and 1610 m a.s.l. would have begun to form in the Early and Middle Holocene, and those situated between 1760 and 2014 m a.s.l. would have begun their formation in the Late Holocene. In the southern hemisphere, the average temperatures would have been 9 °C lower than current average temperatures between 22 and 18 kyr BP. and, from 2 to 5 °C lower between 18 and 12 kyr BP. Between 12 and 8.8 kyr BP, the average temperatures varied from +2 to - 1 °C in relation to the current average temperatures. The favorable area for the establishment of vegetation cover in SdEM was smaller in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than in the warmer periods of the Holocene. The radiocarbon age of the basement layer of SdEM peatlands decreases with increased altitude. The colder climate of the Late Pleistocene limited the formation of peatlands above 1570 m a.s.l. in SdEM.},

abstract = {Relative carbon isotope ratio ([delta]13C values) of primary and secondary products from different compartments of annual plants, pine needles, wood, and decomposing Basidiomycetes have been determined. An enrichment in 13C was found for storage tissues of annual plants, because of the high level of the primary storage products sucrose and starch; however, the enrichment was even greater in leaf starch. All of these compounds had the same relative 13C enrichment in positions 3 and 4 of glucose. Secondary products in conifer needles (lignin, lipids) were depleted in 13C by 1 to 2 [per mille (thousand) sign] relative to carbohydrates from the same origin. Air pollution caused a small decrease in [delta]13C values; however, the relative content of plant products, especially of the soluble polar compounds, was also affected. Decomposing fungi showed a global accumulation of 13C by 4[per mille (thousand) sign] relative to their substrates in wood. Their chitin was enriched by 2[per mille (thousand) sign] relative to the cellulose of the wood. Hence, Basidiomycetes preferentially metabolize "light" molecules, whereas "heavy" molecules are preferentially polymerized. Our results are discussed on the basis of a kinetic isotope effect on the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction and of metabolic branching on the level of the triose phosphates with varying substrate fluxes.},

abstract = {Farmland biodiversity is an important characteristic when assessing sustainability of agricultural practices and is of major international concern. Scientific data indicate that agricultural intensification and pesticide use are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss. The analysed data and experiences do not support statements that herbicide-resistant crops provide consistently better yields than conventional crops or reduce herbicide amounts. They rather show that the adoption of herbicide-resistant crops impacts agronomy, agricultural practice, and weed management and contributes to biodiversity loss in several ways: (i) many studies show that glyphosate-based herbicides, which were commonly regarded as less harmful, are toxic to a range of aquatic organisms and adversely affect the soil and intestinal microflora and plant disease resistance; the increased use of 2,4-D or dicamba, linked to new herbicide-resistant crops, causes special concerns. (ii) The adoption of herbicide-resistant crops has reduced crop rotation and favoured weed management that is solely based on the use of herbicides. (iii) Continuous herbicide resistance cropping and the intensive use of glyphosate over the last 20 years have led to the appearance of at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species worldwide. Although recommended for many years, farmers did not counter resistance development in weeds by integrated weed management, but continued to rely on herbicides as sole measure. Despite occurrence of widespread resistance in weeds to other herbicides, industry rather develops transgenic crops with additional herbicide resistance genes. (iv) Agricultural management based on broad-spectrum herbicides as in herbicide-resistant crops further decreases diversity and abundance of wild plants and impacts arthropod fauna and other farmland animals. Taken together, adverse impacts of herbicide-resistant crops on biodiversity, when widely adopted, should be expected and are indeed very hard to avoid. For that reason, and in order to comply with international agreements to protect and enhance biodiversity, agriculture needs to focus on practices that are more environmentally friendly, including an overall reduction in pesticide use. (Pesticides are used for agricultural as well non-agricultural purposes. Most commonly they are used as plant protection products and regarded as a synonym for it and so also in this text.).},

abstract = {CO(2) efflux from soil depends on the availability of organic substances respired by roots and microorganisms. Therefore, photosynthetic activity supplying carbohydrates from leaves to roots and rhizosphere is a key driver of soil CO(2). This fact has been overlooked in most soil CO(2) studies because temperature variations are highly correlated with solar radiation and mask the direct effect of photosynthesis on substrate availability in soil. This review highlights the importance of photosynthesis for rhizosphere processes and evaluates the time lag between carbon (C) assimilation and CO(2) release from soil. Mechanisms and processes contributing to the lag were evaluated. We compared the advantages and shortcomings of four main approaches used to estimate this time lag: (1) interruption of assimilate flow from leaves into the roots and rhizosphere, and analysis of the decrease of CO(2) efflux from soil, (2) time series analysis (TSA) of CO(2) fluxes from soil and photosynthesis proxies, (3) analysis of natural delta 13C variation in CO(2) with photosynthesis-related parameters or delta 13C in the phloem and leaves, and (4) pulse labeling of plants in artificial 14CO(2) or 13CO(2) atmosphere with subsequent tracing of 14C or 13C in CO(2) efflux from soil. We concluded that pulse labeling is the most advantageous approach. It allows clear evaluation not only of the time lag, but also of the label dynamics in soil CO(2), and helps estimate the mean residence time of recently assimilated C in various above- and belowground C pools. The impossibility of tracing the phloem pressure-concentration waves by labeling approach may be overcome by its combination with approaches based on TSA of CO(2) fluxes and its delta 13C with photosynthesis proxies. Numerous studies showed that the time lag for grasses is about 12.5 +/- 7.5 (SD) h. The time lag for mature trees was much longer (similar to 4-5 days). Tree height slightly affected the lag, with increasing delay of 0.1 day m-1. By evaluating bottle-neck processes responsible for the time lag, we conclude that, for trees, the transport of assimilates in phloem is the rate-limiting step. However, it was not possible to predict the lag based on the phloem transport rates reported in the literature. We conclude that studies of CO(2) fluxes from soil, especially in ecosystems with a high contribution of root-derived CO(2), should consider photosynthesis as one of the main drivers of C fluxes. This calls for incorporating photosynthesis in soil C turnover models.},

abstract = {Peatlands are being mapped globally because they are one of the largest pools of terrestrial carbon (C). Most inventories of C have been conducted in northern Sphagnum dominated peatlands or tropical peatlands. Northern white-cedar (cedar, Thuja occidentalis L.) peatlands are amongst the most common peatland types in the Great Lakes Region of North America, yet there is no information on their C pool sizes or rates of C accumulation. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the ages of cedar peatlands; 2) the amount of C stored in the peat profile; and 3) the apparent long-term rate of C accumulation. We sampled 14 cedar peatland sites across northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Cedar peat was found to be derived mostly from wood and to have an average thickness of 1.12 m (range 0.3–3.25 m). Basal dates indicated that cedar peatlands were initiated between 1,970 and 8,590 years ago, and they appear to have been continuously occupied by cedar. Long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LARCA) ranged from a low of 6.4 g C m-2 yr-1 to a high of 39.7 g C m-2 yr-1 , averaging 17.5 g C m-2 yr-1 . Cedar peatlands tend to be shallower than Sphagnum peatlands in the region but, due to their higher bulk density (average 0.16 g cm-3 ), they contain high amounts of C with our sites averaging $\sim$80 kg C m-2 . Thus, they represent a regionally important pool of C.},

abstract = {Background: The ecosystem services provided by forests are essential for societal well-being. Production forests are increasingly expected to provide a range of ecosystem services in addition to wood biomass, as well as the biodiversity upon which many of these services depend. Production forests can be managed using different methods that affect the habitat provided and the biodiversity supported. Clearcutting (CC) is a widely used forest management system that has been criticised due to its negative effects on biodiversity. Alternative less intensive forest management systems have been developed with the hope of producing comparable levels of biomass with fewer negative impacts on forest biodiversity. One of these alternatives is continuous cover forestry (CCF); a management system that always maintains tree cover in an uneven-aged production forest stand. Many studies have been conducted which contrast the effects of CCF and CC on biodiversity with varying results. The aim of the review is to explore how CCF system compares to CC in terms of outcomes for terrestrial forest biodiversity. Methods: Due to the diverse vocabulary used to describe CCF, a systematic search for terms was carried out and a comprehensive search string will be used to maximise the likelihood of finding all relevant papers. We will gather, summarise and synthesise primary field studies, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, from temperate and boreal forest comparing biodiversity in CCF and CC stands. Species richness and abundance of plants, animals and fungi will be used to conduct a meta-analysis. Other biodiversity indicators and indices will be used for a narrative synthesis. As the effects of forest management depend on local conditions, we place a special emphasis on exploring the influence of various effect modifiers.},

abstract = {Loss of biodiversity impacts ecosystem functions, such as carbon (C) cycling. Soils are the largest terrestrial C reservoir, containing more C globally than the biotic and atmospheric pools together. As such, soil C cycling, and the processes controlling it, has the potential to affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations and subsequent climate change. Despite the growing evidence of links between plant diversity and soil C cycling, there is a dearth of information on whether similar relationships exist between soil biodiversity and C cycling. This knowledge gap occurs even though there has been increased recognition that soil communities display high levels of both taxonomic and functional diversity and are key drivers of fluxes of C between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we used meta-analysis and regression analysis to quantitatively assess how soil biodiversity affects soil C cycling pools and processes (i.e., soil C respiration, litter decomposition, and plant biomass). We compared the response of process variables to changes in diversity both within and across groups of soil organisms that differed in body size, a grouping that typically correlates with ecological function. When studies that manipulated both within- and across-body size group diversity were included in the meta-analysis, loss of diversity significantly reduced soil C respiration (−27.5%) and plant tissue decomposition (−18%) but did not affect above- or belowground plant biomass. The loss of within-group diversity significantly reduced soil C respiration, while loss of across-group diversity did not. Decomposition was negatively affected both by loss of within-group and across-group diversity. Furthermore, loss of microbial diversity strongly reduced soil C respiration (−41%). In contrast, plant tissue decomposition was negatively affected by loss of soil faunal diversity but was unaffected by loss of microbial diversity. Taken together, our findings show that loss of soil biodiversity strongly impacts on soil C cycling processes, and highlight the importance of diversity across groups of organisms (e.g., primary consumers and secondary decomposers) for maintaining full functionality of C cycle processes. However, our understanding of the complex relationships between soil biodiversity and C cycling processes is currently limited by the sheer number of methodological concerns associated with these studies, which can greatly overestimate or underestimate the impact of soil biodiversity on soil C cycling, challenging extrapolation to natural field settings. Future studies should attempt to further elucidate the relative importance of taxonomic diversity (species numbers) versus functional diversity.},

In the present study we propose a modification of the classical rhizobox/micro suction cup system to make it suitable for the collection and analysis of organic acids in the rhizosphere. In order to show the potential of the method, we tested the modified system with Lupinus albus L. as a model plant known to exude large amounts of citrate. The suction cups were installed through the transparent front plate of the rhizoboxes just after the emergence of cluster roots in order to allow optimal localized collection of soil solution. A small dead-volume allowed almost immediate stabilisation with formaldehyde of the sampled soil solutions in the collection container to prevent microbial degradation. The concentrations of organic acids were significantly larger in the rhizosphere soil solution of active cluster roots of Lupinus albus L. than in the bulk soil solution (about 400 µM of citrate versus <0.05 µM). We were able to follow the exudation process in-situ, which occurred during 2–3 days. Also the concentrations of other organic acids and inorganic anions differed between the bulk soil and the rhizosphere of cluster roots, normal roots, and nodules.},

abstract = {Models are needed to estimate dynamics of carbon in forest soils, because changes in soil carbon are laborious to measure, and future levels of soil carbon can only be predicted using models. Current process-oriented soil carbon models are not suitable to all forestry-related applications. This is because they require specific input information that is not available for all forests, and their time step is shorter than a year which is typically used in forestry. We developed a dynamic soil carbon model Yasso to be used in forestry applications. Yasso simulates the stock of soil carbon, changes in this stock and the release of carbon from soil on an annual basis. It needs estimates of litter production, information on litter quality and basic data on climate to run. Yasso consists of five decomposition compartments and two woody litter compartments. Its parameter values were determined based on measurements of litter decomposition and soil carbon. The reliability of the output of Yasso was assessed by conducting an uncertainty analysis and comparing model-calculated estimates of soil carbon to measurements taken at different forest sites in southern Finland. According to the uncertainty analysis, the estimates for the amount of soil carbon are uncertain by nature, because they depend mostly on uncertain humus parameters. Still, when linked to a forest simulator to calculate litter production, Yasso gave similar estimates for the amount of soil carbon as were measured. The estimates for changes in soil carbon, on the other hand, are more reliable by nature because they depend on more accurately known parameters. These and other tests conducted so far suggest that Yasso is applicable to forests in a wide range of environments. Further tests will increase confidence in using it for different soils. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mathematical simulation models are commonly applied to analyze experimental or environmental data and eventually to acquire predictive capabilities. Typically these models depend on poorly defined, unmeasurable parameters that need to be given a value. Fitting a model to data, so-called inverse modelling, is often the sole way of finding reasonable values for these parameters. There are many challenges involved in inverse model applications, e. g., the existence of non-identifiable parameters, the estimation of parameter uncertainties and the quantification of the implications of these uncertainties on model predictions. The R package F M E is a modeling package designed to confront a mathematical model with data. It includes algorithms for sensitivity and Monte Carlo analysis, parameter identifiability, model fitting and provides a Markov-chain based method to estimate parameter confidence intervals. Although its main focus is on mathematical systems that consist of differential equations, F M E can deal with other types of models. In this paper, F M E is applied to a model describing the dynamics of the HIV virus.},

abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse helds of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design-a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

abstract = {Expansion of biomass energy production using woody feedstocks is being accomplished through post-timber harvest removal of coarse woody debris>10cm. The effect of this management on forest Lepidoptera is poorly known. The present study aimed to determine whether forest lepidopteran diversity and species composition were affected by two silvicultural disturbances: timber harvest and post-logging removal of coarse woody debris>10.0cm in diameter. In 2014, Lepidoptera were sampled from nine forest stands subject to one of three management treatments: control (no manipulation at all), clear cut and partial retention of coarse woody debris (80% removal), and clear cut and complete removal of coarse woody debris. As expected, species richness and composition were significantly impacted by timber harvest. Subsequent removal of 80% or 100% coarse woody debris, however, did not affect specialists, detritivores and pollinators. The absence of an effect as a result of the removal of coarse woody debris could be a result of the limited number of replicate stands, small stand size and the limited range of retention treatments. We suggest, however, that retention of fine woody debris with a diameter<10.0cm and inclusion of unlogged stands in the forest landscape maintains some of the habitat elements necessary for Lepidoptera.},

@article{Magnusson2016,
abstract = {Worldwide, forests have absorbed around 30% of global anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, thereby acting as important carbon (C) sinks. It is proposed that leaving large fragments of dead wood, coarse woody debris (CWD), in forest ecosystems may contribute to the forest C sink strength. CWD may take years to centuries to degrade completely, and non-respired C from CWD may enter the forest soil directly or in the form of dissolved organic C. Although aboveground decomposition of CWD has been studied frequently, little is known about the relative size, composition and fate of different C fluxes from CWD to soils under various substrate-specific and environmental conditions. Thus, the exact contribution of C from CWD to C sequestration within forest soils is poorly understood and quantified, although understanding CWD degradation and stabilization processes is essential for effective forest C sink management. This review aims at providing insight into these processes on the interface of forest ecology and soil science, and identifies knowledge gaps that are critical to our understanding of the effects of CWD on the forest soil C sink. It may be seen as a “call-to-action” crossing disciplinary boundaries, which proposes the use of compound-specific analytical studies and manipulation studies to elucidate C fluxes from CWD. Carbon fluxes from decaying CWD can vary considerably due to interspecific and intraspecific differences in composition and different environmental conditions. These variations in C fluxes need to be studied in detail and related to recent advances in soil C sequestration research. Outcomes of this review show that the presence of CWD may enhance the abundance and diversity of the microbial community and constitute additional fluxes of C into the mineral soil by augmented leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Leached DOC and residues from organic matter (OM) from later decay stages have been shown to be relatively enriched in complex and microbial-derived compounds, which may also be true for CWD-derived OM. Emerging knowledge on soil C stabilization indicates that such complex compounds may be sorbed preferentially to the mineral soil. Moreover, increased abundance and diversity of decomposer organisms may increase the amount of substrate C being diverted into microbial biomass, which may contribute to stable C pools in the forest soil.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of techniques have recently been developed for studying the root system architecture (RSA) of seedlings grown in various media. In contrast, methods for sampling and analysis of the RSA of field-grown plants, particularly for details of the lateral root components, are generally inadequate.\n\nMETHODS: An integrated methodology was developed that includes a custom-made root-core sampling system for extracting intact root systems of individual maize plants, a combination of proprietary software and a novel program used for collecting individual RSA information, and software for visualizing the measured individual nodal root architecture.\n\nKEY RESULTS: Example experiments show that large root cores can be sampled, and topological and geometrical structure of field-grown maize root systems can be quantified and reconstructed using this method. Second- and higher order laterals are found to contribute substantially to total root number and length. The length of laterals of distinct orders varies significantly. Abundant higher order laterals can arise from a single first-order lateral, and they concentrate in the proximal axile branching zone.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The new method allows more meaningful sampling than conventional methods because of its easily opened, wide corer and sampling machinery, and effective analysis of RSA using the software. This provides a novel technique for quantifying RSA of field-grown maize and also provides a unique evaluation of the contribution of lateral roots. The method also offers valuable potential for parameterization of root architectural models.},

Their distribution strongly correlates with native prairie ecosystems, but is not limited to them. They are most prevalent in the mid-latitudes of North America, Eurasia, and South America. In North America, they cover 200 million ha of the United States, more than 40 million ha of Canada and 50 million ha of Mexico. Across Eurasia they cover around 450 million ha, extending from the western 148 million ha in southern Russia and 34 million ha in Ukraine to the eastern 35 million ha in northeast China. They are common to South America's Argentina and Uruguay, covering about 89 million and 13 million ha, respectively. Mollisols are often recognized as inherently productive and fertile soils. They are extensively and intensively farmed, and increasingly dedicated to cereals production, which needs significant inputs of fertilizers and tillage. Mollisols are also important soils in pasture, range and forage systems. Thus, it is not surprising that these soils are prone to soil erosion, dehumification (loss of stable aggregates and organic matter) and are suffering from anthropogenic soil acidity. Therefore, soil scientists from all of the world's Mollisols regions are concerned about the sustainability of some of current trends in land use and agricultural practices. These same scientists recommend increasing the acreage under minimum or restricted tillage, returning plant residues and adding organic amendments such as animal manure to maintain or increase soil organic matter content, and more systematic use of chemical amendments such as agricultural limestone to replenish soil calcium reserves.},

abstract = {Soil, a natural four- dimensional body at the atmosphere–lithosphere interface, is organic- carbon- mediated realm in which solid, liquid, and gaseous phases interact at a range of scales and generate numerous ecosystem goods and ser- vices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) strongly impacts soil quality, functionality and health. Terms soil quality and soil health should not be used interchangeable. Soil quality is related to what it does (functions), whereas soil health treats soil as a living biological entity that affects plant health. Through plant growth, soil health is also connected with the health of animals, humans, and ecosystems within its domain. Through supply of macro- and micronutrients, soil health, mediated by SOC dynamics is a strong determinant of global food and nutri- tional security. Soil C pool consists of two related but distinct components: SOC and soil inorganic C (SIC). The SIC pool comprises of primary and sec- ondary carbonates, and the latter consists of calcitic (no net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 ) and silicatic (net sequestration). While SOC is highly dynamic, its mean residence time depends on the degree of protection (physical, chemi- cal, biological, and ecological) within the soil matrix. Formation of stable mi- croaggregates and of organo–mineral complexes can protect SOC against microbial processes for millennia. In addition to formation of silicatic type of secondary carbonates, leaching of bicarbonates into the subsoil or shallow water table is also an important mechanism of sequestration of CO2 as SIC. Numerous soil functions and ecosystem services depend on SOC and its dynamics. Improve- ments in soil health, along with increase in availability of water and nutrients, increases soil's resilience against extreme climate events (e.g., drought, heat wave) and imparts disease- suppressive attributes. Enhancing and sustaining soil health is also pertinent to advancing Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N. such as alleviating poverty, reducing hunger, improving health, and promoting economic development.},

The observed dynamics of SOC and TN in the topsoil of a 28-year-old fallow experiment on Haplic Chernozem was modelled using the Candy Carbon Balance (CCB) model. This study selected two treatments from this experiment where the soil was kept bare with mechanical or chemical (herbicides) treatments. The CCB model was improved to include the SOC related change of soil physical parameters and dynamic handling of the physically stabilised SOM pool. Over 28 years of bare fallow the top soil lost about 10 t/ha of SOC and > 1 t/ha of TN. The results from observation and modelling reflected the increased SOM turnover due to soil tillage. The modelled size of the physically stabilised SOC pool was about 55% of total SOC and only reduced slowly during the almost three decades, but the implementation of this effect improved simulation results and reduced the relative RMSD (unitless) from 0.051 to 0.044 for SOC and from 0.053 to 0.049 for TN error level. From these results we conclude that the larger the SOM change the more important is the integration of the turnover of physically stabilised SOM within the modelling approach.},

We found that a suite of biotic and abiotic variables account for up to 86% of the variation in EMF, with the combined effects of above- and belowground biodiversity accounting for 45% of the variation in EMF. Our results have two important implications: first, including belowground biodiversity in models can improve the ability to explain and predict EMF. Second, regional-scale variation in climate, and perhaps climate change, can determine, or at least modify, the effects of biodiversity on EMF in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {The effects of 13 years of biennial application of four organic amendments (compost, green manure, farmyard manure and sewage sludge) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, microbial biomass and community structure were compared with those of bare fallow, an unfertilised control and N-fertilised treatments. The experiment was conducted on a clay soil in western Sweden, in a randomised block design with four replicates. The crops grown were spring barley and oats. Changes in SOC mass were estimated by the 'equivalent soil mass' concept. Carbon inputs from crops were calculated from grain yields using linear allometric functions. The decomposition rate of soil organic matter was derived from a bare fallow treatment. Humification coefficients, defined here as the fraction of C input entering the SOC pool, for the organic amendments and crop residues were estimated by fitting a single-pool first order model to the final SOC stocks. The humification coefficient was highest for domestic waste compost (0.9) and lowest for above-ground crop residues (0.19). Crop yields were highest in sewage sludge-amended soil, probably due to favourable physical soil conditions, as indicated by lower bulk density (1.27-1.30gcm-3) than in the other treatments (1.32-1.38gcm-3). Despite addition of relatively high amounts of organic N, yields in other treatments receiving organic amendments were significantly lower than in those receiving mineral N fertiliser. In particular, the compost material was found to be highly recalcitrant, as indicated by its low C/N ratio (10) and low crop yield. Comparison of the correlation between phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration and SOC showed that compost supported relatively less microbial biomass than the other substrates tested. An important finding was that differences in SOC between treatments were significant to 40cm depth and that up to 27% of the SOC changes observed to 40cm depth occurred in the upper subsoil (25-40cm). Thus, SOC changes below ploughing depth should be considered in SOC balance studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The study aimed specifically at investigating if canopy openness was a better predictor of the height growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) advance regeneration than overstorey basal area or overstorey standing volume. In 1990, a field experiment with 3 x 2 factorial design and two replications (blocks) was established in an uneven-aged Norway spruce forest. Plots had a net plot area of 30 x 30 m, each with a 10-m-wide treated buffer zone. Three overstorey density levels retained approximately 15, 40 and 70 per cent of the pre-harvest overstorey standing volume and were allotted to the plots. Two types of thinning that harvested smaller trees or harvested larger trees were randomly allocated to each pair of overstorey density plots. In mid-June 2000, canopy openness was estimated from hemispherical photographs taken at five marked points in the centre of each of the plots at 0.9 m from ground to the top of the 'fish-eye' camera lens. Regression results showed that canopy openness was a better predictor of height increments of spruce seedlings (0.1 < height < 0.5 m), saplings (0.5 ≤ height ≤ 2.0 m), and small trees (height ≥ 2.0 m, diameter at 1.3 m height < 5 cm) than with overstorey basal area (m2 ha-1) or overstorey standing volume (m3 ha-1). The height increment of the spruce advance regeneration was not significantly correlated to stand basal area or to standing volume. Overstorey basal area in the net plots was significantly negative (P ≤ 0.05) with mean canopy openness estimates, and the r2 value was 0.40. Results indicated that basal area was not linearly related to canopy openness as it increased, which might explain the lack of predictive power of retained basal area on spruce regeneration height in dense stands in boreal Sweden. {\textcopyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2005.

@article{Berhongaray2019,
abstract = {Background and aims: Soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual is central to the discussion on active atmospheric CO 2 removal strategies, but it requires a clear understanding of the mechanisms driving new SOC formation. SOC is formed from the decomposition of above- and below-ground plant inputs, yet their accurate quantification remains a major challenge. In the current study the in-growth soil core and $\delta$ 13 C methods were combined to quantify the net C input from single or combined above- and below-ground parts of a poplar (Populus) bioenergy plantation. Methods: Three different mesh sizes were used for the in-growth cores in four different treatments designed to estimate the relative contributions of above-ground litter fall, fine roots and mycorrhizae (C3 input from the poplar) to the new C formation in cores filled with a C4 soil, by applying a mass balance equation. Results: Soil C formation was higher in the treatments with roots as compared to the treatments with above-ground C inputs only (29 vs 16 g C m −2 ), despite the disproportionally lower root inputs as compared to above-ground C inputs (34 vs 175 g C m −2 y −1 ). Soil C formation from different sources (above- and below-ground) was additive; i.e. the observed soil C formation in the combined treatment was the sum of those in the single soil C input treatments. As a result, below-ground C-inputs had a high conversion efficiency to SOC of 76%. Above-ground plant inputs had a very low SOC formation efficiency of 9%, and were presumably mainly mineralized by microorganisms. Conclusion: The higher soil C accumulation rates from below-ground C inputs are particularly important in bioenergy plantations where the above-ground biomass is frequently removed for biomass and energy production.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (OM) can be stabilized against decomposition by association with minerals, by its inherent recalcitrance and by occlusion in aggregates. However, the relative contribution of these factors to OM stabilization is yet unknown. We analyzed pool size and isotopic composition (14C, 13C) of mineral-protected and recalcitrant OM in 12 subsurface horizons from 10 acidic forest soils. The results were related to properties of the mineral phase and to OM composition as revealed by CPMAS 13C-NMR and CuO oxidation. Stable OM was defined as that material which survived treatment of soils with 6 wt% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Mineral-protected OM was extracted by subsequent dissolution of minerals by 10% hydrofluoric acid (HF). Organic matter resistant against NaOCl and insoluble in HF was considered as recalcitrant OM. Hypochlorite removed primarily 14C-modern OM. Of the stable organic carbon (OC), amounting to 2.4-20.6 g kg-1 soil, mineral dissolution released on average 73%. Poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases (Feo, Alo) and crystalline Fe oxides (Fed-o) explained 86% of the variability of mineral-protected OC. Atomic Cp/(Fe+Al)p ratios of 1.3-6.5 suggest that a portion of stable OM was associated with polymeric Fe and Al species. Recalcitrant OC (0.4-6.5 g kg-1 soil) contributed on average 27% to stable OC and the amount was not correlated with any mineralogical property. Recalcitrant OC had lower $\Delta$14C and $\delta$ 13C values than mineral-protected OC and was mainly composed of aliphatic (56%) and O-alkyl (13%) C moieties. Lignin phenols were only present in small amounts in either mineral-protected or recalcitrant OM (mean 4.3 and 0.2 g kg-1 OC). The results confirm that stabilization of OM by interaction with poorly crystalline minerals and polymeric metal species is the most important mechanism for preservation of OM in these acid subsoil horizons. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

The species of weeds that plague crops today are a consequence of the historical past, being related to the history of the evolution of crops and farming practices. Chemical weed control began over a century ago with inorganic compounds and transitioned to the age of organic herbicides. Targeted herbicide research has created a steady stream of successful products. However, safeners have proven to be more difficult to find. Once found, the mode of action of the safener must be determined, partly to help in the discovery of further compounds within the same class. However, mounting regulatory and economic pressure has changed the industry completely, making it harder to find a successful herbicide. Herbicide resistance has also become a major problem, increasing the difficulty of controlling weeds. As a result, the development of new molecules has become a rare event today.},

abstract = {Recent studies have examined the ecological and evolutionary bases for variation in animal personality. However, only a few such studies have examined how foraging parameters are influenced by different personality domains. In wild ungulates, the trade-off between the time spent on food intake and antipredator behaviour differs between individuals, but the underlying reason for this is not yet well understood. One possibility is that this trade-off reflects personality dimensions such as boldness. To relate foraging decisions to personality we measured personality and performed feeding experiments with familiar and novel food in familiar and novel situations. We measured personality traits in 15 tame fallow deer, using novel object tests (NO), behavioural observations (BO) and personality ratings (PR). Boldness dimensions were found using PR and NO, dominance dimensions were found using BO and PR, and a flexibility dimension was found using BO. Multitrait-multimethod analysis showed that similar dimensions were significantly correlated across different methods and that different dimensions were not significantly correlated, even if measured using the same method. We also found that novel food eaten in familiar situations and familiar food eaten in novel situations were strongly related to boldness but not dominance, flexibility or age. Thus the trade-off between the benefits of gaining more food and the costs of reduced vigilance or increased toxin ingestion reflect boldness. These findings highlight the nature of personality dimensions in ungulates and how boldness impacts foraging behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Avoidance of roads has been demonstrated for many animal species, but little is known about the relationship between anthropogenic disturbance levels and the degree of avoidance by animals. We investigated the hypothesis that the strength of road-avoidance behaviour increases with the intensity of the disturbance for a large, disturbance-sensitive herbivore: the forest-dwelling caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou. We assessed the behaviour of 53 global positioning system-collared caribou monitored during the gradual modification of a highway over a 7-year period, while controlling for potentially confounding factors. We studied caribou movements, resource selection and distribution before, during and after road modifications at multiple scales. We expected that the degree of avoidance would be positively related to road width, traffic density and the presence of active construction sites. The proportion of individuals that excluded the highway from their home range increased as highway modifications progressed.Alower proportion of caribou locations was found in a 5000 m road-effect zone during and after highway modifications compared with before. Within that zone, caribou avoided habitat types that were selected at the home range scale. Caribou displayed higher movement rates in the vicinity of the highway, especially when traffic density was high. Our data support the hypothesis that avoidance of roads by large herbivores is positively related to disturbance intensity. Our results shed light on the behavioural mechanisms determining avoidance of human infrastructure by large herbivores, and suggest that increased human activity may affect behaviour at multiple scales. Conservation efforts in areas where roads are constructed or modified should be directed towards maintaining access to critical habitat resources, while also restoring habitat quantity and quality.},

This study estimates how extraction of fine woody debris (FWD) may affect the overall habitat availability for 577 species of wood-and bark-inhabiting basidiomycetes, beetles, and lichens in Sweden using Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) as their primary substrate. We combined modeling of (i) the amount of various types of woody debris available throughout a forest rotation in managed forests with (ii) a classification of each species' associations with different types of wood. In three different regions, we compared a scenario with no logging residue extraction with three different levels of extraction. Our results suggest that the extraction may cause a 35%-45% reduction in aboveground FWD and a more than 20% decline in the potential amount of substrate for about 50% of the species (affecting basidiomycetes and beetles more than lichens). The intensified forestry during the last century has, however, steadily increased the production of FWD. Furthermore, no red-listed species is primarily associated with logging residues of Norway spruce. Therefore, the current situation in Sweden with extraction of 70% of Norway spruce FWD on 50% of the clearcuts probably constitutes a minor contribution to the regional extinction risks.},

abstract = {Soil properties were compared in adjacent 50-year-old Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands growing on similar soils in south-west Sweden. The effects of tree species were most apparent in the humus layer and decreased with soil depth. At 20-30cm depth in the mineral soil, species differences in soil properties were small and mostly not significant. Soil C, N, K, Ca, Mg, and Na content, pH, base saturation and fine root biomass all significantly differed between humus layers of different species. Since the climate, parent material, land use history and soil type were similar, the differences can be ascribed to tree species. Spruce stands had the largest amounts of carbon stored down to 30cm depth in mineral soil (7.3kgCm-2), whereas birch stands, with the lowest production, smallest amount of litterfall and lowest C:N ratio in litter and humus, had the smallest carbon pool (4.1kgCm-2), with pine intermediate (4.9kgCm-2). Similarly, soil nitrogen pools amounted to 349, 269, and 240gNm-2 for spruce, pine, and birch stands, respectively. The humus layer in birch stands was thin and mixed with mineral soil, and soil pH was highest in the birch stands. Spruce had the thickest humus layer with the lowest pH. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many research works propose sophisticated methods to analyse the carbon balance, while only a few tools are available for the calculation of both greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration with simplified methods. This paper describes a carbon balance assessment conducted at farm level with a simplified methodology, which includes calculations of both CO2 emissions and carbon sequestration in crop rotations. This carbon balance was tested in the Montepaldi Long Term Experiment (MOLTE) trial in central Italy, where two agroecosystems managed with two different farming practices (organic vs conventional) are compared. Both in terms of CO2eq emissions and carbon sequestration, this simplified method applied in our experiment provided comparable results to those yielded by complex methodologies reported in the literature. With regard to the crop rotation scheme applied in the reference period (2003-2007), CO2 emissions from various farm inputs were found to be significantly lower (0.74 Mg ha–1) in the organically managed system than in the conventionally managed system (1.76 Mg ha–1). The same trend was observed in terms of CO2eq per unit of product (0.30 Mg kg–1 in the organic system and 0.78 Mg kg–1 in the conventional system). In the conventional system the sources that contributed most to total emissions were direct and indirect emissions associated with the use of fertilisers and diesel fuel. Also the stock of sequestered carbon was significantly higher in the organic system (27.9 Mg ha–1 of C) than in the conventional system (24.5 Mg ha–1 of C). The carbon sequestration rate did not show any significant difference between the two systems. It will be necessary to test further this methodology also in commercial farms and to validate the indicators to monitor carbon fluxes at farm level.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 British Society of Soil Science. Estimation of inputs of belowground carbon constitutes a major uncertainty in carbon (C) balance models. Fixed allocation coefficients are widely used although root:shoot ratio is known to respond to abiotic stressors. This pot experiment investigated the C allocation response of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) to soil texture and nutrient availability. Differences in nutrient availability, induced by a long-term history of contrasting N and PK fertilizer application to the soil, did not affect root:shoot ratio. Soil texture had a significant effect; the smallest root:shoot ratio (0.10) occurred in a clay loam soil and the largest (0.22) was in a sandy soil. We hypothesized that this relation was related to hydraulic properties of the root-soil contact zone and were able to confirm this relation with existing datasets from the literature. The results obtained in this study could be useful for future estimates of root-derived C inputs, for example in carbon turnover models, but thorough in situ validation with different plant species is required. Highlights: We tested soil texture and nutrient controls on root:shoot ratios of spring barley in a pot experiment. Soil texture rather than nutrient availability was the most important factor affecting root growth The largest root:shoot ratio in the sandy soil might be related to water availability The texture effect proved to be significant in a meta-analysis of data from literature},

Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

abstract = {We revisited the well documented and ongoing long-term 'Ultuna continuous soil organic matter field experiment' which started in 1956 at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The objective of the experiment is to quantify effects of six organic amendments and mineral N fertilizers on the crop and soil. We used the 'equivalent soil mass' concept for estimating changes in the topsoil carbon stocks in all 15 treatments. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop yields. Clustering C inputs into seven categories by quality allowed us to calculate a 'humification' coefficient for each category. Here, these coefficients were simply based on the fraction of total C input that still remains in the topsoil after about 50. years. As indicated by previous studies, this coefficient was highest for peat, followed by sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and above-ground crop residues. The most interesting result from the current investigation is that the optimized coefficient for root-derived carbon was about 2.3 times higher than that for above-ground plant residues. The calculated results were found to be robust in a sensitivity analysis. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that root-derived carbon contributes more to relatively stable soil C pools than the same amount of above-crop residue-derived C. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil microbial communities contain the highest level of prokaryotic diversity of any environment, and metagenomic approaches involving the extraction of DNA from soil can improve our access to these communities. Most analyses of soil biodiversity and function assume that the DNA extracted represents the microbial community in the soil, but subsequent interpretations are limited by the DNA recovered from the soil. Unfortunately, extraction methods do not provide a uniform and unbiased subsample of metagenomic DNA, and as a consequence, accurate species distributions cannot be determined. Moreover, any bias will propagate errors in estimations of overall microbial diversity and may exclude some microbial classes from study and exploitation. To improve metagenomic approaches, investigate DNA extraction biases, and provide tools for assessing the relative abundances of different groups, we explored the biodiversity of the accessible community DNA by fractioning the metagenomic DNA as a function of (i) vertical soil sampling, (ii) density gradients (cell separation), (iii) cell lysis stringency, and (iv) DNA fragment size distribution. Each fraction had a unique genetic diversity, with different predominant and rare species (based on ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [RISA] fingerprinting and phylochips). All fractions contributed to the number of bacterial groups uncovered in the metagenome, thus increasing the DNA pool for further applications. Indeed, we were able to access a more genetically diverse proportion of the metagenome (a gain of more than 80% compared to the best single extraction method), limit the predominance of a few genomes, and increase the species richness per sequencing effort. This work stresses the difference between extracted DNA pools and the currently inaccessible complete soil metagenome.},

abstract = {Genotypes with extreme phenotypes are valuable for studying 'difficult' quantitative traits. Genomic prediction (GP) might allow the identification of such extremes by phenotyping a training population of limited size and predicting genotypes with extreme phenotypes in large sequences of germplasm collections. We tested this approach employing seedling root traits in maize and the extensively genotyped Ames Panel. A training population made up of 384 inbred lines from the Ames Panel was phenotyped by extracting root traits from images using the software program aria. A ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction strategy was used to train a GP model. Genomic estimated breeding values for the trait 'total root length' (TRL) were predicted for 2431 inbred lines, which had previously been genotyped by sequencing. Selections were made for 100 extreme TRL lines and those with the predicted longest or shortest TRL were validated for TRL and other root traits. The two predicted extreme groups with regard to TRL were significantly different (P = 0.0001). The difference in predicted means for TRL between groups was 145.1 cm and 118.7 cm for observed means, which were significantly different (P = 0.001). The accuracy of predicting the rank between 1 and 200 of the validation population based on TRL (longest to shortest) was determined using a Spearman correlation to be rho = 0.55. Taken together, our results support the idea that GP may be a useful approach for identifying the most informative genotypes in sequenced germplasm collections to facilitate experiments for quantitative inherited traits.},

abstract = {Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia store at least 42 000 Million metric tonnes (Mt) of soil carbon. Human activity and climate change threatens the stability of this large pool, which has been decreasing rapidly over the last few decades owing to deforestation, drainage and fire. In this paper we estimate the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions resulting from drainage of lowland tropical peatland for agricultural and forestry development which dominates the perturbation of the carbon balance in the region. Present and future emissions from drained peatlands are quantified using data on peatland extent and peat thickness, present and projected land use, water management practices and decomposition rates. Of the 27.1 Million hectares (Mha) of peatland in Southeast Asia, 12.9 Mha had been deforested and mostly drained by 2006. This latter area is increasing rapidly because of increasing land development pressures. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission caused by decomposition of drained peatlands was between 355 Mt y -1 and 855 Mt y -1 in 2006 of which 82% came from Indonesia, largely Sumatra and Kalimantan. At a global scale, CO 2 emission from peatland drainage in Southeast Asia is contributing the equivalent of 1.3% to 3.1% of current global CO 2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel. If current peatland development and management practices continue, these emissions are predicted to continue for decades. This warrants inclusion of tropical peatland CO 2 emissions in global greenhouse gas emission calculations and climate mitigation policies. Uncertainties in emission calculations are discussed and research needs for improved estimates are identified. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {Poplar (Populus spp.) species are currently not widely grown in Sweden but offer interesting options for future large-scale biomass production for bioenergy. This study assesses the average annual net energy yield and the ratio between the gross energy yield and the total primary energy input for well-managed current commercial poplar production systems in Sweden, with and without fertilization with mineral nitrogen (N). The two systems perform similarly, mainly because the yield response to fertilization is estimated to be small. The average annual net energy yields with and without fertilization are estimated at 190 and 179 GJ ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The corresponding energy ratios are 32 and 34, i.e., the total primary energy inputs correspond to only ca. 3% of the gross energy yield, in both cases. Therefore, improving the net energy yield by increasing the harvest level may be considered the most important objective from an energy performance point of view. To do this, more research is needed in order to develop poplar clones that are better adapted to the Swedish climate and identify in which situations poplar responds well to fertilization. At the same time, by reducing the energy inputs associated with the most fuel-intensive activities (wood-chip transportation, chipping, harvesting, forwarding, and stump lifting), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The results should be interpreted with caution since several parameters, especially the yield response to fertilization and fuel consumption rates, are associated with considerable uncertainties.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the optimal harvesting of uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and birch (Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh.) stands. The analysis is based on an economic description of uneven-aged forestry using a size-structured transition matrix model and a single-tree model. The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form using gradient-based interior point methods. Increasing the harvesting interval decreases the annual volume yield. Assuming natural regeneration, this suggests that volume yield is maximized by uneven-aged rather than even-aged management. The present value of stumpage revenues is maximized after saw timber and pulpwood prices, interest rate, and a 15-year harvesting interval are included. The economically optimal solution with a 3% interest rate produces an annual yield of 1.9, 6.2, and 3.1 cubic meters for Scots pine, Norway spruce, and birch, respectively. Both the optimal volume yield and net present value maximization solutions converge to unique species- and site-type-specific steady states with constant harvests. The transition matrix model typically used in optimization studies is computationally less demanding than the single-tree model, but the differences in optimal solutions are more remarkable than earlier studies suggest.},

abstract = {This chapter presents general methods combining stochastic simulation and Markov decision process models, with a specific application to the issue of discounting ecological criteria. The literature argues for and against discounting ecological costs and benefits like standard financial investments. As part of this debate, this chapter investigates some purely ecological consequences of discounting ecological criteria. The methods are Markov decision process models with infinite time horizon and discounted or undiscounted ecological objectives, based on bootstrap simulations of stand growth. The data were from Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, with the assumption of continuous-cover forestry. The ecological criteria examined here included the stand basal area per hectare, the tree species and size diversity measured with Shannon's index, and the percentage of the forest in late seral stage. In maximizing expected tree species diversity, 18 out of 64 possible stand states would call for different decisions with discounting. For tree size diversity, the decisions differed for five stand states. For basal area all but two states called for the same decision. For late seral forest frequency, discounting led to different decisions for 13 stand states. However, for only a few stand states were the ecological criteria substantially different immediately after harvest. Thus, discounting would matter only for a few stand states, which in the study area had a low frequency. Given this initial condition, only the expected late seral forest frequency differed substantially after a decade with discounting. In the long run, the initial condition does not matter and discounting the criteria gave very similar values as not discounting.},

abstract = {Processing of organic carbon (C) by soil microorganisms is a key process of terrestrial C cycling. For this reason we studied (i) microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) defined as C allocated to growth over organic C taken up by the microbial community, and (ii) the turnover time of microbial biomass in a pasture and in two forest soils. We hypothesized that microbial CUE decreases in mineral soils with depth from the topsoil to the subsoil, while the turnover time of the microbial biomass increases due to energetic constrains. We determined microbial CUE and turnover of microbial biomass C using a novel substrate-independent method based on incorporation of18O from labeled water into microbial DNA with concurrent measurements of basal respiration. Microorganisms showed decreasing C uptake rates with decreasing C contents in the deeper soil layers. In the forest soils, no adaptation of microbial CUE with soil depth took place, i.e., microbes in the forest topsoil used C at the same efficiency as microbes in the subsoil. However, in the pasture soil, microbial CUE decreased in the lower soil layers compared to the topsoil, indicating that microorganisms in the deeper soil layers allocated relatively more C to respiration. In the organic soil layer, microorganisms respired more per unit microbial biomass C than in the subsoil, but had a similar CUE despite the high C-to-nitrogen and C-to-phosphorus ratios of the litter layers. The turnover time of microbial biomass increased with soil depth in the two forest soils. Thus, in the forest soils, a lower microbial C uptake rate in the deeper soil layers was partially compensated by a longer turnover time of microbial biomass C. In conclusion, our findings emphasize that in addition to microbial CUE, the turnover time of the microbial biomass strongly affects soil C cycling.},

abstract = {Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture with predictions that 1.35. million. metric tons will be used annually by 2017. With the advent of glyphosate tolerant (GT) cropping more than 10. years ago, there is now concern for non-target effects on soil microbial communities that has potential to negatively affect soil functions, plant health, and crop productivity. Although extensive research has been done on short-term response to glyphosate, relatively little information is available on long-term effects. Therefore, the overall objective was to investigate shifts in the rhizosphere bacterial community following long-term glyphosate application on GT corn and soybean in the greenhouse. In this study, rhizosphere soil was sampled from rhizoboxes following 4 growth periods, and bacterial community composition was compared between glyphosate treated and untreated rhizospheres using next-generation barcoded sequencing. In the presence or absence of glyphosate, corn and soybean rhizospheres were dominated by members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria (particularly gammaproteobacteria) increased in relative abundance for both crops following glyphosate exposure, and the relative abundance of Acidobacteria decreased in response to glyphosate exposure. Given that some members of the Acidobacteria are involved in biogeochemical processes, a decrease in their abundance could lead to significant changes in nutrient status of the rhizosphere. Our results also highlight the need for applying culture-independent approaches in studying the effects of pesticides on the soil and rhizosphere microbial community.},

abstract = {The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion is contributing to recent climate change which is among the major challenges facing the world. Agroforestry systems can contribute to slowing down those increases and, thus, contribute to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry refers to the production of crop, livestock, and tree biomass on the same area of land. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, in particular, is the only terrestrial pool storing some carbon (C) for millennia which can be deliberately enhanced by agroforestry practices. Up to 2.2 Pg C (1 Pg = 1015 g) may be sequestered above- and belowground over 50 years in agroforestry systems, but estimations on global land area occupied by agroforestry systems are particularly uncertain. Global areas under tree intercropping, multistrata systems, protective systems, silvopasture, and tree woodlots are estimated at 700, 100, 300, 450, and 50 Mha, respectively. The SOC storage in agroforestry systems is also uncertain and may amount up to 300 Mg C ha−1 to 1 m depth. Here, we review and synthesize the current knowledge about SOC sequestration processes and their management in agroforestry systems. The main points are that (1) useful C sequestration in agroforestry systems for climate change mitigation must slow or even reverse the increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by storing some SOC for millennia, (2) soil disturbance must be minimized and tree species with a high root biomass-to-aboveground biomass ratio and/or nitrogen-fixing trees planted when SOC sequestration is among the objectives for establishing the agroforestry system, (3) sequestration rates and the processes contributing to the stabilization of SOC in agroforestry soils need additional data and research, (4) retrospective studies are often missing for rigorous determination of SOC and accurate evaluation of effects of different agroforestry practices on SOC sequestration in soil profiles, and (5) the long-term SOC storage is finite as it depends on the availability of binding sites, i.e., the soil's mineral composition and depth. Based on this improved knowledge, site-specific SOC sequestering agroforestry practices can then be developed.},

abstract = {Background: Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important element of forest structure that needs to be considered when managing forests for biodiversity, carbon storage or bioenergy. To manage it effectively, dynamics of CWD decomposition should be known. Methods: Using a chronosequence approach, we assessed the decomposition rates of downed CWD of Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, which was sampled from three different years of tree fall and three different initial diameter classes (>10 – ≤ 20 cm, >20 – ≤40 cm, >40 cm). Samples originating from wind throws in 1999 were collected along a temperature and precipitation gradient. Based on the decay class and associated wood densities, log volumes were converted into CWD mass and C content. Log fragmentation was assessed over one year for log segments of intermediate diameters (>20 – 40 cm) after 8 and 18 years of decomposition. Results: Significantly higher decomposition constants (k) were found in logs of F. sylvatica (0.054 year−1) than in P. abies (0.033 year−1) and P. sylvestris (0.032 year−1). However, mass loss of P. sylvestris occurred mainly in sapwood and hence k for the whole wood may be overestimated. Decomposition rates generally decreased with increasing log diameter class except for smaller dimensions in P. abies. About 74 % of the variation in mass remaining could be explained by decomposition time (27 %), tree species (11 %), diameter (17 %), the interactive effects between tree species and diameter (4 %) as well as between decomposition time and tree species (3 %) and a random factor (site and tree; 9.5 %), whereas temperature explained only 2 %. Wood fragmentation may play a more important role than previously thought. Here, between 14 % and 30 % of the decomposition rates (for the first 18 years) were attributable to this process. Carbon (C) density (mgC {\textperiodcentered} cm−3), which was initially highest for F. sylvatica, followed by P. sylvestris and P. abies, decreased with increasing decay stage to similar values for all species. Conclusions: The apparent lack of climate effects on decomposition of logs in the field indicates that regional decomposition models for CWD may be developed on the basis of information on decomposition time, tree species and dimension only. These can then be used to predict C dynamics in CWD as input for C accounting models and for habitat management.},

abstract = {The explicit representation of microbial communities in soil biogeochemical models is improving their projections, promoting new interdisciplinary research, and stimulating novel theoretical developments. However, microbes are the foundation of complicated soil food webs, with highly intricate and non-linear interactions among trophic groups regulating soil biogeochemical cycles. This food web includes fauna, which influence litter decomposition and the structure and activity of the microbial community. Given the early success of microbial-explicit models, should we also consider explicitly representing faunal activity and physiology in soil biogeochemistry models? Here we explore this question, arguing that the direct effects of fauna on litter decomposition are stronger than on soil organic matter dynamics, and that fauna can have strong indirect effects on soil biogeochemical cycles by influencing microbial population dynamics, but the direction and magnitude of these effects remains too unpredictable for models used to predict global biogeochemical patterns. Given glaring gaps in our understanding of fauna-microbe interactions and how these might play out along climatic and land use gradients, we believe it remains early to explicitly represent fauna in these global-scale models. However, their incorporation into models used for conceptual exploration of food-web interactions or into ecosystem-scale models using site-specific data could provide rich theoretical breakthroughs and provide a starting point for improving model projections across scales.},

abstract = {The long-term carbon balance (CB) of unmanaged forest was compared to the CBs of management scenarios which included cuttings. The calculations were done for a typical forest holding representing mineral soil sites in Central Finland. CB was calculated for twenty-one 10-year periods. Three carbon stores and sub-balances were included in the analysis: (1) below-and above-ground biomass of living trees; (2) forest soil (dead organic matter); and (3) wood-based products. Substitution effects and the releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the CB of products. The no-cutting scenario had the best CB for 120-130 years, after which the cutting scenarios were better. In the no-cutting scenario, the CB of living biomass turned zero after 150 years and the CB of forest soils was still positive after 200 years. At the end of the 210-year simulation period the CB of the unmanaged forest was 0.09 Mg C ha-1a-1 suggesting that old-growth forest is a weak carbon sink. Heavy selective cutting in a mature forest removing half of growing stock volume had a negative influence on the CB of forestry for three decades, after which the balance was better than without cutting. Since the negative and positive effects of cutting have different durations, conclusions about the effect of cutting depend on the length of the time horizon. Because the net effect of cutting is negative in the short term, a shortsighted analysis leads to no-cutting decision when carbon sequestration is maximized, which is a wrong decision in a longer term. When harvested volume was equal to volume increment, the carbon stocks stabilized to 65 Mg C ha-1 for living biomass, 80 Mg C ha-1 for soil and 18 Mg C ha-1 for products.},

abstract = {Sport hunting may help in controlling cervid populations over large areas. As with natural predators, several environmental factors can influence sport harvest. A better understanding of the environmental variables that limit the efficiency of sport hunting could provide guidelines for more efficient wildlife management using hunting. We studied white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting on a high deer density island where hunting was the sole form of predation. Our objective was to study the behavior of sport hunters and determine the habitat characteristics (e.g., abundance of deer forage, visibility of the deer from the hunter's point of view, and accessibility of the territory to hunters) that are associated with a successful harvest. We collected movements and harvest site location data from 477 hunters equipped with handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Harvest sites were visited and characterized, along with a paired random site, to determine the environmental conditions associated with a successful hunt. We also developed a model to predict the daily number of deer seen by hunters considering weather conditions, hunter characteristics (e.g., age, experience), and date of hunting. We used the mean number of deer seen per hunter per day as a relative index of local density in each hunted territory. At both the site and landscape scales, the combination of visibility and access had a positive effect on the distribution of harvested deer. Habitat types with less visual obstruction from vegetation enabled hunters to see more deer in a given day. At the site scale, harvested deer were located in areas with a lower density of access routes compared to areas where hunters travelled throughout the day. Using an innovative approach of studying hunter behavior with GPS technology, digital maps, and questionnaires, we highlighted the factors associated with hunter success. Our study suggests that habitat characteristics could be modified to increase harvest by improving accessibility and visibility near roads. Creating openings in mature and regenerating forest near access roads could make sport hunting a more efficient management tool, but the potential impact of increased forage availability in forest openings should not be overlooked. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

The effectiveness of this management tool is widely debated. The relative importance of factors associated with compensation success is unclear and little is known about global geographic or taxonomic differences in the application of compensation programs.

We analyzed 288 publications referencing wildlife compensation and identified 138 unique compensation programs. These publications reported US$222 million after adjusting for inflation spent on compensation in 50 countries since 1980. Europe was the continent with the most papers and the most reported funding, and wolves and bears were the most frequently compensated target of conflict. Authors of the publications we reviewed made twice as many negative comments compared to positive comments regarding compensation. Three quarters of the negative comments related to program administration. Conversely, three quarters of the positive comments related to program outcomes. The three most common suggestions to improve compensation programs included requiring claimants to employ damage prevention practices, such as improving livestock husbandry or fencing in crops in order to receive compensation (n=25, 15%); modifying ex post compensation schemes to some form of outcome-based performance payment (n=21, 12%); and altering programs to make compensation payments more quickly (n=14, 8%). We suggest that further understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of compensation as a conflict mitigation tool will require more systematic evaluation of the factors driving these opinions, and that differentiating process and outcomes and understanding linkages between them will result in more fruitful analyses and ultimately more effective conflict mitigation.},

abstract = {To determine the dominant processes controlling nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils and increase insights into soil N cycling from nitrogen isotope (<515N) data, patterns of 15N enrichment in soil profiles were compiled from studies on tropical, temperate, and boreal systems. The maximum 15N enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9.6 ± 0.4%o in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4.6 ± 0.5%o in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The 15N enrichment varied little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification rates. One main factor controlling l5N in soil profiles, fraction- ation against 15N during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants, leads to 15N-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and 15N-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential preservation of 15N-enriched compounds during decomposition and stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss during nitrification and denitrifi- cation, may account for large 15N enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for soil profiles where maximum <515N is at intermediate depths. Mixing among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil horizons. We sug- gest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within soil profiles that can incorporate multiple processes could provide additional information about the history of nitrogen movements and transforma- tions at a site.},

abstract = {As one kind of land use practice, traditional agroforestry systems already have a long history of hundreds of years in practice and still play a significant role in the world today, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. In this era of globalization and food in security, more and more governments and non-governmental organizations are paying attention to traditional agroforestry systems because of their economic, ecological and socio-culture benefits. These benefits are also in accord with the characteristics of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). So far, four typical traditional agroforestry systems from five countries have been designated as GIAHS. These traditional agroforestry systems have rich agricultural and associated biodiversity, multiple ecosystem services and precious socio-culture values at a regional and global level. Although traditional agroforestry systems are confronted with many threats and challenges, such as population growth, migration, market impact, climate change and so on, as long as governments and non-governmental organizations, local communities and smallholders can cooperate with each other, traditional agroforestry systems will be effectively protected and will remain in the future a sustainable global land use practice.},

@article{Peterson2007,
abstract = {Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been described by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction defined by DeltaG(Dagger)(cat), and irreversible inactivation defined by DeltaG(Dagger)(inact). However, such a model does not account for the observed temperature-dependent behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been developed and validated. This model (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at high temperatures, by including an inactive form of the enzyme (E(inact)) that is in reversible equilibrium with the active form (E(act)); it is the inactive form that undergoes irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose temperature-dependence is characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the equilibrium, DeltaH(eq), and a new thermal parameter, T(eq), which is the temperature at which the concentrations of E(act) and E(inact) are equal; T(eq) may therefore be regarded as the thermal equivalent of K(m). Characterization of an enzyme with respect to its temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore include a determination of these intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model has major implications for enzymology, biotechnology and understanding the evolution of enzymes. The present study presents a new direct data-fitting method based on fitting progress curves directly to the Equilibrium Model, and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of assay data on the accurate determination of T(eq) and its associated parameters. It also describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been previously available, including those required for the application of the Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.},

abstract = {Widespread global changes, including rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, climate warming and loss of biodiversity, are predicted for this century; all of these will affect terrestrial ecosystem processes like plant litter decomposition. Conversely, increased plant litter decomposition can have potential carbon-cycle feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 levels, climate warming and biodiversity. But predicting litter decomposition is difficult because of many interacting factors related to the chemical, physical and biological properties of soil, as well as to climate and agricultural management practices. We applied 13C-labelled plant litter to soil at ten sites spanning a 3500-km transect across the agricultural regions of Canada and measured its decomposition over five years. Despite large differences in soil type and climatic conditions, we found that the kinetics of litter decomposition were similar once the effect of temperature had been removed, indicating no measurable effect of soil properties. A two-pool exponential decay model expressing undecomposed carbon simply as a function of thermal time accurately described kinetics of decomposition. (R2 = 0.94; RMSE = 0.0508). Soil properties such as texture, cation exchange capacity, pH and moisture, although very different among sites, had minimal discernible influence on decomposition kinetics. Using this kinetic model under different climate change scenarios, we projected that the time required to decompose 50% of the litter (i.e. the labile fractions) would be reduced by 1–4 months, whereas time required to decompose 90% of the litter (including recalcitrant fractions) would be reduced by 1 year in cooler sites to as much as 2 years in warmer sites. These findings confirm quantitatively the sensitivity of litter decomposition to temperature increases and demonstrate how climate change may constrain future soil carbon storage, an effect apparently not influenced by soil properties.},

This position paper returns to the concepts of that publication and reviews the progress made since 2010. A new development is the wide introduction and acceptance of social media and web applications, which dramatically changes the context and scale of stakeholder interactions and participation. Technology advances make it easier to incorporate information in interactive formats via visualization and games to augment participatory experiences. Citizens as stakeholders are increasingly demanding to be engaged in planning decisions that affect them and their communities, at scales from local to global. How people interact with and access models and data is rapidly evolving. In turn, this requires changes in how models are built, packaged, and disseminated: citizens are less in awe of experts and external authorities, and they are increasingly aware of their own capabilities to provide inputs to planning processes, including models. The continued acceleration of environmental degradation and natural resource depletion accompanies these societal changes, even as there is a growing acceptance of the need to transition to alternative, possibly very different, life styles. Substantive transitions cannot occur without significant changes in human behaviour and perceptions. The important and diverse roles that models can play in guiding human behaviour, and in disseminating and increasing societal knowledge, are a feature of stakeholder processes today.},

We first introduce various supporting concepts and models with their empirical databases, model validation and constraints. Secondly, Swedish single-tree growth functions designed for more heterogeneously structured forest are tested using data from inventory plots, a thinning experiment in an uneven-aged forest stand, and yield plots in pristine forest. Future growth of a managed, multi-layered forest was simulated and is compared with other selected functions. Simulation results, expected errors and time constraints are discussed. For most models, projected stand basal area growth deviated 10-20% from the observed growth in individual stands. In single stands, the deviation ranged from 0 to 60%. Validation periods were often 5-15 years, sometimes even more than 30 years. For Swedish single-tree basal area growth functions, on average, a 5% overestimate was found for heterogeneously structured forest across Sweden. Observed growth in a boreal single-tree selection forest was underestimated by 12.5% fifteen years after thinning from above.},

abstract = {The change of current pools of soil C in Norway spruce ecosystems in Sweden were studied using a process-based model (CoupModel). Simulations were conducted for four sites representing different regions covering most of the forested area in Sweden and representing annual mean temperatures from 0.7°C to 7.1°C. The development of both tree layer and field layer (understory) was simulated during a 100-year period using data on standing stock volumes from the Swedish Forest Inventory to calibrate tree growth using different assumptions regarding N supply to the plants. The model successfully described the general patterns of forest stand dynamics along the Swedish climatic transect, with decreasing tree growth rates and increasing field layer biomass from south to north. However, the current tree growth pattern for the northern parts of Sweden could not be explained without organic N uptake and/or enhanced mineralisation rates compared to the southern parts. Depending on the assumption made regarding N supply to the tree, different soil C sequestration rates were obtained. The approach to supply trees with both mineralised N and organic N, keeping the soil C:N ratio constant during the simulation period was found to be the most realistic alternative. With this approach the soils in the northern region of Sweden lost 5 g C m-2 year-1, the soils in the central region lost 2 g C m-2 year-1, and the soils in the two southern regions sequestered 9 and 23 g C m-2 year-1, respectively. In addition to climatic effects, the feedback between C and N turnover plays an important role that needs to be more clearly understood to improve estimates of C sequestration in boreal forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees' general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees' relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence. Finally, we offer an agenda for micro-level research on corporate social responsibility. Contents},

abstract = {Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content depending on different factors are extensively investigated when the soil is in steady-state equilibrium between formation and decomposition of soil organic matter. However, studies of SOC formation and dynamics in initally organic matter free soil are rare. Evolution of soil organic carbon was studied in a field experiment established in 1964 on a carbonaceous glacial till soil with very low initial SOC content (1.28 g kg−1). The effects on SOC content changes of bare fallow, barley and different perennial fodder crops such as grasses, clover-grass mixture, galega, hybrid lucerne and a turfgrass mixture, with or without mineral N and PK fertilisation and manure, were studied. There were 19 treatments in total and most had unchanged plant cover composition throughout the experiment. During 1964–2014, SOC stock increased in all treatments, by 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1 in bare fallow and by at most 0.50 Mg ha−1 y−1 in the treatment with hybrid lucerne and manure. Average SOC sequestration rate was 0.35 ± 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1. SOC changes were highly correlated with estimated C inputs and were therefore higher in treatments with perennials than with an annual barley crop. C retention efficiency for total crop-derived C inputs and for organic amendments was 6.1% and 22%, respectively. Water-soluble C measured in 2014 increased linearly with SOC, indicating that the quality of recently formed SOC was not strongly affected by the treatments. However, water-soluble C as a fraction of SOC was significantly lower in treatments with legumes than in treatments with bare fallow or a barley or grass crop. These results demonstrate that the quantity and quality of C inputs were both main drivers for observed changes in SOC. However, C retention efficiency of C inputs was relatively low. This may be related to soil texture with high sand proportion, suggesting that SOC sequestration rates in light-textured soils may be lower than expected even in case of low initial SOC content.},

abstract = {EMERGENCE IS NOT WELL DEFINED, BUT ALL EMERGENT SYSTEMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: the whole is more than the sum of the parts, they show bottom-up rather top-down organization and, if biological, they involve chemical signaling. Self-organization can be understood in terms of the second and third stages of thermodynamics enabling these stages used as analogs of ecosystem functioning. The second stage system was suggested earlier to provide a useful analog of the behavior of natural and agricultural ecosystems subjected to perturbations, but for this it needs the capacity for self-organization. Considering the hierarchy of the ecosystem suggests that this self-organization is provided by the third stage, whose entropy maximization acts as an analog of that of the soil population when it releases small molecules from much larger molecules in dead plant matter. This it does as vigorously as conditions allow. Through this activity, the soil population confers self-organization at both the ecosystem and the global level. The soil population has been seen as both emergent and self-organizing, supporting the suggestion that the two concepts are are so closely linked as to be virtually interchangeable. If this idea is correct one of the characteristics of a biological emergent system seems to be the ability to confer self-organization on an ecosystem or other entity which may be larger than itself. The beehive and the termite colony are emergent systems which share this ability.},

abstract = {The impact of deer grazing on agricultural grassland and cereal crops was assessed at two locations with medium to high deer densities in the Exmoor area of southwest England. Red deer impact on early spring grazing was measured at one site by comparing samples of herbage cut from inside and outside deer-proof exclosure cages, just prior to turn out of livestock, on 1 March 1989. Fallow deer impact on first-cut silage grass production was similarly measured using exclosure cages at a second site by cutting samples on 31 May 1990 and on 6 June 1995. In addition, impact of fallow deer on cereal crops was assessed at this site by measuring sample grain yields from areas of the crop used or unused by deer in 1995 (winter wheat), 1996 (winter barley) and 1997 (winter wheat). Significant dry matter yield losses were recorded for red deer impact on spring grazing in 1989 (14.5%) and for fallow deer impact on first-cut silage (15.9%) in 1995 but not in 1990. In 1995 a small but significant yield loss (7.1%) was recorded for winter wheat at the fallow deer site but no loss in cereal yield was recorded in 1996 or 1997. These assessments, carried out in response to complaints about deer damage, suggest that the impacts of deer in this area, where they occur at relatively high density, are only moderate. This highlights the need for careful assessment of cost-benefits when considering deer management strategies to reduce perceived agricultural damage.},

abstract = {Glyphosate is an active substance of the most used herbicides worldwide. Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max™ (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick ™ (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49mgL-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick ™. Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change mitigation and food security are two of the main challenges of human society. Agroforestry systems, defined as the presence of trees on external and internal boundaries, cropland, or on any other available niche of farmland, can provide both climate change mitigation and food. There are several types of agroforestry systems with different rates of above ground and soil carbon (C) sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestered can depend on the type of system, climate, time since land use change and previous land use. Data was collected from a total of 86 published and peer reviewed studies on soil and above ground carbon sequestration for different agroforestry systems, climates and regions in the world. The objective was to understand which agroforestry systems provide the greatest benefits, and what are the main factors influencing, soil and above ground carbon sequestration. The results show that, on average, more soil carbon sequestration occurs in agroforestry systems classified as silvopastoral (4.38 tC ha−1yr−1), and more above ground carbon sequestration occurs in improved fallows (11.29 tC ha−1yr−1). On average, carbon benefits are greater in agroforestry systems Tropical climates when compared to agroforestry systems located in other climates, both in terms of soil (2.23 tC ha−1yr−1) and above ground (4.85 tC ha−1yr−1). In terms of land use change, the greatest above ground carbon sequestration (12.8 tC ha−1yr−1) occurs when degraded land is replaced by improved fallow and the greatest soil carbon sequestration (4.38 tC ha−1yr−1) results from the transition of a grassland system to a silvopastoral system. Time since the change is implemented was the main factor influencing above ground carbon sequestration, while climate mainly influences soil carbon sequestration most. The results of the analysis may be used to inform practitioners and policy makers on the most effective agroforestry system for carbon sequestration. The lack of data on carbon stocks before the implementation land use change and the lack of reporting on soil sampling design and variances were the main limitations in the data. The need to report this data should be considered in future studies if agroforestry systems are expected to play an important role as a climate change mitigation strategy.},

abstract = {Poplar (Populus spp.) species are currently not widely grown in Sweden but offer interesting options for future large-scale biomass production for bioenergy. This study assesses the average annual net energy yield and the ratio between the gross energy yield and the total primary energy input for well-managed current commercial poplar production systems in Sweden, with and without fertilization with mineral nitrogen (N). The two systems perform similarly, mainly because the yield response to fertilization is estimated to be small. The average annual net energy yields with and without fertilization are estimated at 190 and 179 GJ ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The corresponding energy ratios are 32 and 34, i.e., the total primary energy inputs correspond to only ca. 3% of the gross energy yield, in both cases. Therefore, improving the net energy yield by increasing the harvest level may be considered the most important objective from an energy performance point of view. To do this, more research is needed in order to develop poplar clones that are better adapted to the Swedish climate and identify in which situations poplar responds well to fertilization. At the same time, by reducing the energy inputs associated with the most fuel-intensive activities (wood-chip transportation, chipping, harvesting, forwarding, and stump lifting), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The results should be interpreted with caution since several parameters, especially the yield response to fertilization and fuel consumption rates, are associated with considerable uncertainties.},

In this study, we conducted a global analysis of the plant C content by synthesizing data from 4318 species to document specific values and their variation of the C content across plant organs and life forms. Plant organ C contents ranged from 45.0 % in reproductive organs to 47.9 % in stems at global scales, which were significantly lower than the widely employed canonical value of 50 %. Plant C content in leaves (global mean of 46.9 %) was higher than that in roots (45.6 %). Across life forms, woody plants exhibited higher C content than herbaceous plants. Conifers, relative to broad-leaved woody species, had higher C content in roots, leaves, and stems. Plant C content tended to show a decrease with increasing latitude. The life form explained more variation of the C content than climate. Our findings suggest that specific C content values of different organs and life forms developed in our study should be incorporated into the estimations of regional and global vegetation biomass C stocks.},

abstract = {This study presents a critical analysis regarding the assumption of carbon neutrality in life cycle assessment (LCA) models that assess climate change impacts of bioenergy usage. We identified a complex of problems in the carbon neutrality assumption, especially regarding bioenergy derived from forest residues. In this study, we summarized several issues related to carbon neutral assumptions, with particular emphasis on possible carbon accounting errors at the product level. We analyzed errors in estimating emissions in the supply chain, direct and indirect emissions due to forest residue extraction, biogenic CO2 emission from biomass combustion for energy, and other effects related to forest residue extraction. Various modeling approaches are discussed in detail. We concluded that there is a need to correct accounting errors when estimating climate change impacts and proposed possible remedies. To accurately assess climate change impacts of bioenergy use, greater efforts are required to improve forest carbon cycle modeling, especially to identify and correct pitfalls associated with LCA accounting, forest residue extraction effects on forest fire risk and biodiversity. Uncertainties in accounting carbon emissions in LCA are also highlighted, and associated risks are discussed.},

abstract = {Many projections of the soil carbon sink or source are based on kinetically defined carbon pool models. Parameters of these models are often determined in a way that the steady state of the model matches observed carbon stocks. The underlying simplifying assumption is that observed carbon stocks are near equilibrium. This assumption is challenged by observations of very old soils that do still accumulate carbon. In this modelling study we explored the consequences of the case where soils are apart from equilibrium. Calculation of equilibrium states of soils that are currently accumulating small amounts of carbon were performed using the Yasso model. It was found that already very small current accumulation rates cause big changes in theoretical equilibrium stocks, which can virtually approach infinity. We conclude that soils that have been disturbed several centuries ago are not in equilibrium but in a transient state because of the slowly ongoing accumulation of the slowest pool. A first consequence is that model calibrations to current carbon stocks that assume equilibrium state, overestimate the decay rate of the slowest pool. A second consequence is that spin-up runs (simulations until equilibrium) overestimate stocks of recently disturbed sites. In order to account for these consequences, we propose a transient correction. This correction prescribes a lower decay rate of the slowest pool and accounts for disturbances in the past by decreasing the spin-up-run predicted stocks to match an independent estimate of current soil carbon stocks. Application of this transient correction at a Central European beech forest site with a typical disturbance history resulted in an additional carbon fixation of 5.7±1.5 tC/ha within 100 years. Carbon storage capacity of disturbed forest soils is potentially much higher than currently assumed. Simulations that do not adequately account for the transient state of soil carbon stocks neglect a considerable amount of current carbon accumulation.},

Fertilization greatly increased microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) (C(mic) and N(mic)) as well as the activities of phosphatase, urease, invertase, protease, catalase and dehydrogenase. Manure alone (M) enhanced the number of denitrifying and aerobic bacteria by 54.4% and 20.5%, respectively, whereas fallow (H) increased the number of aerobic cellulose decomposing bacteria by 31.4%. Fallow and soils amended with mineral fertilizers plus pig manure or straw increased both the DGGE band patterns and the Shannon index compared with mineral fertilizers or the control. Mineral treatments with lower bacterial numbers enhanced the values of the peak time (t(max)) more than did organic treatments. The peak height (P(max)) was positively correlated (P<0.01), with soil enzymes, C(mic) and N(mic), and the number of microorganisms, whereas the peak time (t(max)) was negatively connected (P<0.01) with these parameters. The microbial growth rate constant (k) was linked to bacteria (P<0.01), actinomycetes (P<0.05) and catalase (P<0.05). The total heat evolution (Q) had no relationships with any soil microbial properties (except for catalase). We propose that P(max) and t(max) could be used as indices of soil microbial activity, while the values of k and Q are poor indicators.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Finnish Society of Forest Science. All rights reserved. Accurate estimates of both above-ground biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) are essential for estimating carbon (C) balances at various geographical scales and formulating effective climate change mitigation programs. However, estimating BGB is challenging, particularly for forest ecosystems, so robust allometric equations are needed. To obtain such equations for savanna-woodlands of the West African north sudanian zone, we selected four common native woody species (Anogeissus leiocarpa (DC.) Guill. & Perr., Detarium microcarpum Guill. & Perr., Piliostigma thonningii (Schumach.) Milne-Redh. and Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn.). At two sites in Burkina Faso, we determined the BGB of 30 trees of each of these species by excavation, and measured various above-ground dimensional variables. The root:shoot ratio varied widely among the species, from 0.1 to 3.4. Depending on the species, allometric equations based on stem basal area at 20 cm height, basal area at breast height and tree height explained 50-95% of the variation in BGB. The best generic equation we obtained, based on basal area at 20 cm, explained 60% of the variation in BGB across the species. Three previously published generic allometric equations underestimated BGB by 8 to 63%. The presented equations should significantly improve the accuracy of BGB estimates in savanna-woodlands and help avoid costly needs to excavate root systems.},

abstract = {Carbon use efficiency (CUE) describes the relative partitioning of carbon (C) between anabolic and catabolic processes within the soil microbial community. Further, it represents a major factor regulating the amount of C cascading through the trophic levels of the soil food web. How CUE relates to C supply, however, remains poorly understood. The primary aim of this study was to determine how CUE varies across a range of spatial scales as a function of C substrate supply. Our secondary aim was to understand how variations in substrate CUE influences the interpretation of community level physiological profiles (CLPP). Using 16 different 14C-labelled substrates (including amino acids, sugars, organic acids and amino sugars) and soils collected at the field, regional and continental scale, we measured the rate of substrate uptake and mineralization from which we calculated CUE. Across all soils (n = 114) and substrates (n = 16), the average CUE for the microbial community was 0.568 ± 0.004 (range 0.492–0.794). While the partitioning of substrate-C within the biomass (immobilization/mineralization) over 72 h was highly conserved for some substrates (e.g. glucose), others showed a wide variability in CUE across the samples (e.g. valine). In the context of the CLPP methodology, we showed that individual sites could be statistically separated from each other, irrespective of whether the statistical analysis was based on microbial substrate uptake rate or mineralization rate. However, our results do suggest that caution is needed when ascribing observed CLPP differences to the importance of individual C pathways operating in soil due to the wide variation of CUE between substrates. In conclusion, we present new mechanistic evidence to support the paradigm that variation in ecosystem CUE may in part reflect differences in the types of C supplied to the microbial biomass.},

abstract = {This study focused on tree mortality in spruce-dominated stands managed using the single-tree selection method in southern Finland. Together with regeneration and tree growth, mortality is one of the basic elements of the stand structure and dynamics in selection stands. The study was based on data acquired from a set of 20 permanent experimental plots monitored with repeated measurements for 20 years. The average mortality in the number of stems (N) was 4.45 trees ha−1a−1, in basal area (G) 0.07 m2 ha−1a−1, and in stemwood volume (V) 0.56 m3 ha−1a−1. In relative terms it was 0.50% of N, 0.30% of G and 0.27% of V, respectively. Wind and snow were the most common causes of mortality, while deaths by biotic causes (mammals, insects, pathogens) were extremely rare. Some 6–10% of the total loss in the number of stems and volume was attributable to the loss or removal of trees that sustained serious damage in harvesting. Most of the mortality occurred in the smallest diameter classes of up to 20 cm. Such a high mortality among small trees can have an adverse influence on the sustainability of selection structures if not successfully checked in harvesting and management.},

abstract = {In order to increase the harvesting volumes of energy wood and pulpwood from first thinnings, harvesting costs have to be reduced significantly. Mets{\"{a}}teho Oy studied the integrated harvesting of pulpwood and energy wood based on a two-pile method, where industrial roundwood (pulpwood) and energy wood fractions are stacked into two separate piles when cutting a first-thinning stand. The productivity and cost levels of the integrated, two-pile cutting method were determined, and the harvesting costs of the two-pile method were compared with those of conventional separate wood harvesting methods.In the time studies, when the size of removal was 50 dm3, the productivity in conventional whole-tree cutting was 6% higher than in integrated cutting. With a stem size of 100 dm3, the productivity of whole-tree cutting was 7% higher than in integrated cutting. The results indicated, however, that integrated harvesting based on the two-pile cutting method enables harvesting costs to be decreased to below the current cost level of separate pulpwood harvesting in first-thinning stands. The greatest cost-saving potential lies in small-sized (d1.3 = 7-11 cm) first thinnings. The costs of forest haulage after integrated pulpwood and energy wood cutting were higher than those of separate wood harvesting because of lower removals in integrated harvesting. The results showed that when integrated wood harvesting is based on the two-pile cutting method, the removals of both energy wood and pulpwood should be more than 20-25 m3 ha-1 at the integrated harvesting sites in order to achieve economically viable integrated procurement. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the GCTE global Soil Organic Matter Network (SOMNET) before focusing on the European network of long-term sites. We then select two examples from the European site network and demonstrate how such data can be used to (a) track long-term changes in soil organic matter, (b) evaluate and compare soil organic matter models, and (c) make rough estimates of the potential for carbon (C) sequestration in soils at the regional (European) level. Our simple calculations based on only two long-term experiments suggest that amendment of arable soils with 10 Mg ha-1 of organic manure could lead to an increase in current total European soil C stock to 30 cm of about 4.8% over 90 yr, a scenario with limited potential for sequestering C. Similarly, afforestation through natural woodland regeneration of 30% of current arable land (surplus to requirements by 2010) could lead to an increase in current total European soil C stock of 12.4% over 100 yr. This is equivalent to 43 Tg C yr-1 or 3.8% of anthropogenic CO2-C emissions from Europe. If temporary C storage in standing woody biomass is included in the estimate, the amount of C sequestered is quadrupled and could account for 15.28% of Europe's annual CO2-C emissions. This is equivalent to 2.8% of annual global anthropogenic CO2-C emissions. These calculations are presented to demonstrate a simple technique for estimating rough C sequestration potentials but they do suggest some potential to sequester C in European agricultural soils. As a result, a more sophisticated approach using statistical relationships derived from a large number of long-term experiments was developed. The need for balancing the effects of these scenarios on soil C against other environmental considerations is discussed. Methods for improving estimates of the potential for soil C sequestration using the European site network are also discussed},

This paper investigates PDMS degradation in the field. Four soil plots (each 2.44 m x 2.44 m) in Michigan were sprayed in May, 1997, with aqueous emulsion to achieve nominal soil PDMS concentrations of 0 (control), 215 (low), 430 (medium), and 860 (high) microg/g. Over the following summer, soil cores (0-5 and 5-10 cm) were collected every two weeks and analyzed for decrease in-total soil PDMS, and decrease in molecular weight of remaining PDMS. PDMS concentrations decreased 50% in 4.5, 5.3, and 9.6 weeks for the low, medium, and high treatments, respectively. Degradation rates were 0.26 (low), 0.44 (medium), and 0.44 (high) g PDMS/m2 day, indicating that degradation capacity of the soil was exceeded by the High treatment. Dimethylsilanediol (DMSD), the main degradation product, was detected in most samples at <5% of original PDMS. This is consistent with laboratory data showing biodegradation and volatilization of DMSD. Deeper sampling (to 20 cm) found only trace amounts of DMSD, and minor downward movement of the polymer. Respraying and subsequent analysis of one plot with a medium treatment in late August showed slow PDMS degradation during the cool, wet fall, followed by a 40% decrease over winter and extensive degradation during the summer of 1998. The study thus shows that PDMS will degrade under field conditions as predicted from laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {Root biomass is one of the most relevant root parameters for studies of plant response to environmental change, soil carbon modeling or estimations of soil carbon sequestration. A major source of error in root biomass quantification of agricultural crops in the field is the presence of extraneous organic matter in soil: dead roots from previous crops, weed roots, incorporated above ground plant residues and organic soil amendments, or remnants of soil fauna. Using the isotopic difference between recent maize root biomass and predominantly C3-derived extraneous organic matter, we determined the proportions of maize root biomass carbon of total carbon in root samples from the Swiss long-term field trial " DOK. " We additionally evaluated the effects of agricultural management (bio-organic and conventional), sampling depth (0–0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.75 m) and position (within and between maize rows), and root size class (coarse and fine roots) as defined by sieve mesh size (2 and 0.5 mm) on those proportions, and quantified the success rate of manual exclusion of extraneous organic matter from root samples. Only 60% of the root mass that we retrieved from field soil cores was actual maize root biomass from the current season. While the proportions of maize root biomass carbon were not affected by agricultural management, they increased consistently with soil depth, were higher within than between maize rows, and were higher in coarse (>2 mm) than in fine (≤2 and >0.5) root samples. The success rate of manual exclusion of extraneous organic matter from root samples was related to agricultural management and, at best, about 60%. We assume that the composition of extraneous organic matter is strongly influenced by agricultural management and soil depth and governs the effect size of the investigated factors. Extraneous organic matter may result in severe overestimation of recovered root biomass and has, therefore, large implications for soil carbon modeling and estimations of the climate change mitigation potential of soils.},

Climate changes add to the complexity via effects on forest ecosystem processes, such as primary production and respiration, and also by adding a new goal on the agenda: the role of forests in climate mitigation. In recent years, the generation of climate model projections, representing a range of future scenarios, has enabled the development of strategic decisions in relation to risk management, and created a demand for cross-sectorial adaptation and mitigation processes. In this ecosystem model study we address these issues from the perspective of Swedish forest owners, by focusing on climate impacts and forest management effects on the potential harvest level, net income, predisposition to storm damage, biodiversity and carbon storage. The objective was to evaluate alternative management strategies, applicable to northern boreal, southern boreal and nemoral conditions. A general finding is that targeted combinations of forest stand management strategies can lead to a higher degree of goal fulfilment at the landscape level than current forest management practice.},

abstract = {We simulated soil carbon stock dynamics of an Austrian coniferous forest stand with five soil-only models (Q, ROMUL, RothC, SoilCO2/RothC and Yasso07) and three plant-soil models (CENTURY, CoupModel and Forest-DNDC) for an 18-year period and the decomposition of a litter pulse over a 100-year period. The objectives of the study were to assess the consistency in soil carbon estimates applying a multi-model comparison and to present and discuss the sources of uncertainties that create the differences in model results. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of different modelling approaches from the view point of large-scale carbon assessments. Our simulation results showed a wide range in soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates reflecting substantial uncertainties in model estimates. The measured stock change estimate decreased much more than the model predictions. Model results varied not only due to the model structure and applied parameters, but also due to different input information and assumptions applied during the modelling processes. Initialization procedures applied with the models induced large differences among the modelled soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates. Decomposition estimates of the litter pulse driven by model structures and parameters also varied considerably. Our results support the use of relatively simple soil-only models with low data requirements in inventory type of large-scale carbon assessments. It is important that the modelling processes within the national inventories are transparently reported and special emphasis is put on how the models are used, which assumptions are applied and what is the quality of data used both as input and to calibrate the models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The process-level understanding of biochar-C decomposition and microbial utilization in soils is poorly understood as well as how these dynamics vary across different addition rates and soil types. We present results from a 30-month laboratory incubation, where oak-derived biochar was added at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 % rate by weight to four soils varying in soil properties. We determined biochar-C loss using natural abundance 13C isotope coupled to measurements of CO2 efflux. We measured microbial abundance, composition, and C use efficiency (CUE) using phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers and 13C labeled glucose, respectively. After 30 months, the amount of the remaining biochar-C was insignificantly different between different biochar addition rates, suggesting that biochar-C loss is proportional to biochar addition rates. In soils with higher C contents (i.e., >1.5 %), biochar decomposition rates appeared to slow down after initial fast decomposition; while biochar decomposition rates followed one-pool model for soils with lower C. Soil microbial composition significantly changed at 10 or 20 % addition rate after 30 months, which was correlated with the increase in soil C/N. The highest CUE was found at 1 or 5 %, depending on soil types.},

abstract = {Forest residues can be left at the harvest site to gradually decompose, or can be collected for energy purposes. This study analyzes the primary energy and climate impacts of bioenergy systems where forest residues are collected and used for electricity, heat and transportation, compared to fossil-based energy systems where fossil fuels provide the same services while forest residues are left on site to decompose. Time profiles are elaborated of primary energy use and carbon dioxide emissions from various energy applications fulfilled by bioenergy or fossil energy systems. Different biological decay functions are considered based on process-based modeling and inventory data across various climate zones. For all scenarios, the changes in cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) are calculated over a 300-year period, to evaluate the short- and long-term contributions of forest residue to climate change mitigation. A life cycle perspective along the full energy chains is used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of each system. The results show largest primary energy and climate benefits when forest residues are collected and used efficiently for energy services. Using biomass to substitute fossil coal provides greater climate change mitigation benefits than substituting oil or fossil gas. Some bioenergy substitutions result in positive CRF, i.e. increased global warming, during an initial period. This occurs for relatively inefficient bioenergy conversion pathways to substitute less carbon intensive fossil fuels, e.g. biomotor fuel used to replace diesel. More beneficial bioenergy substitutions, such as efficiently replacing coal, result immediately in reduced CRF. Biomass decay rates and transportation distance have less influence on climate benefits.},

abstract = {Soil microorganisms are critical to carbon and nutrient fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the annual pattern of soil microbial community structure and how it corresponds to soil nutrient availability and plant production is a fundamental first step towards being able to predict impacts of environmental change on ecosystem functioning. We investigated the composition, structure and nutrient stoichiometry of the soil microbial community in mesic arctic tundra on 9 sample dates in 6 months from winter to fall using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), epifluorescent microscopy and chloroform-fumigation-extraction (CFE). PLFA analysis indicates that the winter microbial community was fungal-dominated, cold-adapted and associated with high C, N and P in the soil solution and microbial biomass. The microscopy data suggest that both bacteria and fungi were active and growing in soils between-5°C and 0°C. A significant shift occurred in the PLFA data, qPCR patterns, microscopy and microbial biogeochemistry after the thaw period, resulting in a distinct community that persisted through our spring, summer and fall sample dates, despite large changes in plant productivity. This shift was characterised by increasing relative abundances of certain bacteria (especially Gram+ves) as well as a decline in fungal biomass, and corresponded with decreasing C, N and P in the soil solution. The summer period of low substrate availability (plant-microbe competition) was associated with microbial indicators of nutritional stress. Overall, our results indicate that tundra microbial communities are clearly differentiated according to the changes in soil nutrient status and environmental conditions that occur between winter and post-thaw, and that those changes reflect functionally important adaptations to those conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in developing vulnerability assessment tools and in applying these methodologies to identify and implement climate change adaptation approaches for forest ecosystems and forest management organizations in Canada and the United States. However, given that adaptation processes are in early stages, evaluation of approaches across agency, organizational, and geographic boundaries is critical. Thus, we conducted a qualitative comparison of three conceptual frameworks for climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation efforts in the Canadian and United States forestry agency contexts. We focus our comparison on components of the conceptual frameworks, development process, intended users, similarities and differences in institutional contexts (geographic and organizational), and implementation. Finally, we present case studies to illustrate how the frameworks have been implemented on the ground and in different contexts. Despite different trajectories of development, the Canadian and US forest agencies have developed similar conceptual frameworks for vulnerability assessment and adaptation. We found that key components of the conceptual frameworks included: establishing a science-management partnership; evaluating current forest conditions and management objectives; conducting detailed science-based vulnerability assessments; developing adaptation approaches and on-the-ground tactics; implementing adaptation tactics; and monitoring outcomes and adjusting as needed. However, the contexts in which these frameworks are implemented vary considerably within and between countries, mostly because of differences in land ownership, management norms, and organizational cultures. On-the-ground applications, although slow to develop, are beginning to proliferate, providing examples that can be emulated by others. A strategy for accelerating implementation of adaptation in Canada and the United States is suggested, building on successes by federal agencies and extending to public, private, and crown lands.},

abstract = {Parametric pedotransfer functions (PTFs), which predict parameters of a model from basic soil properties are useful in deriving continuous functions of soil properties, such as water retention curves. The common method for deriving parametric water retention PTFs involves estimating the parameters of a soil hydraulic model by fitting the model to the data, and then forming empirical relationships between basic soil properties and parameters. The latter step usually utilizes multiple linear regression or artificial neural networks. Neural network analysis is a powerful tool and has been shown to perform better than multiple linear regression. However neural-network PTFs are usually trained with an objective function that fits the estimated parameters of a soil hydraulic model. We called this the neuro-p method. The estimated parameters may carry errors and since the aim is to be able to estimate water retention, it is sensible to train the network to fit the measured water content. We propose a new objective function for neural network training, which predicts the parameters of the soil hydraulic model and optimizes the PTF to match the measured and observed water content, we called this neuro-m method. This method was used to predict the parameters of the van Genuchten model. Using Australian soil hydraulic data as a training set, neuro-m predicted the water retention from bulk density and particle-size distribution with a mean accuracy of 0.04 m3 m-3 The relative improvement of neuro-m over neural networks that was optimized to fit the parameters (neuro-p) is 13%. Compared with a published neural network PTF, the new method is 30% more accurate and less biased.},

abstract = {Sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C) into soils is a strategy to compensate for anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The response of SOCs to crop types is yet to be determined under different environments. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the impact of crop type on the allocation of atmospheric C to shoots and roots, and ultimately to the soils and to determine its association with soil carbon stocks. Three hundred and eighty-nine field trials were compared to determine allocation of biomass and C in plants and SOCs under fields of different crop types. Grasses had the highest plant biomass production (19.80 ± 1.16 Mg ha−1 yr−1), followed by cereals (9.44 ± 0.45 Mg ha−1 yr−1), fibre (7.90 ± 1.00 Mg ha−1 yr−1), legumes (3.29 ± 0.63 Mg ha−1 yr−1), and oil crops (3.05 ± 1.16 Mg ha−1 yr−1) showing significant differences (p < 0.05). Maize (6.3 ± 0.34 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst summer crops, while wheat (2.2 ± 0.35 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst winter crops. In all the studies, crops allocated more C to their shoots than roots yielding root C: shoot C (Rc/Sc) ratios below magnitude. The greatest C allocation to roots was in grasses (Rc/Sc = 1.19 ± 0.08), followed by cereals (0.95 ± 0.03), legumes (0.86 ± 0.04), oil crops (0.85 ± 0.08), and fibre crops (0.50 ± 0.07). There was evidence that high plant C stocks were found in crops grown under carbon rich clayey soils of tropical humid areas. Natural grasses and cereals should be promoted as they appeared to yield greater potential for atmospheric carbon sequestration in plants and soils. Overall, the study evaluated the relative potential of the main crop types to sequester atmospheric C useful in screening of crop types for carbon efficiency and for development of plant C models.},

abstract = {Root distribution pattern plays an important role in understanding and estimating of soil C allocation and the effect of crop roots C input on soil carbon balance in agroecosystems. A database of 96 profiles was compiled and root distribution pattern were fitted to a modified logistic dose response curve for 11 temperate crops. A slight linear decrease between the root mass: length distribution ratio and the soil depth was found for monocotyledons while an exponential decrease with depth was found for dicotyledons. These results indicated that roots were thicker at upper soil layers with the effect much larger for dicotyledons. The estimated depth at which 50% of total root was accumulated for different crops varied from 8 cm to 20 cm. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) showed the deepest rooting profile with a fitted maximum rooting depth (dmax) of 177 cm but another perennial, fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.), had the shallowest dmax of 78 cm. In general, cereal and pulse crop roots were distributed more evenly in soil profile while more roots were accumulated in the upper soil layers for oilseed crops. The estimated root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroecosystem models for good representations of belowground processes and enhance the accuracy of carbon and water cycling estimation in agroecosystem.},

abstract = {The predominant philosophy underlying most environmental modelling is a form of pragmatic realism. The limitations of this approach in practical applications are discussed, in particular, in relation to questions of scale, nonlinearity and uniqueness of place. A new approach arising out of the concept of equifinality of models (structures and parameter sets) in application is outlined in the form of an uncertain 'landscape space' to model space mapping. The possibility of hypothesis testing within this framework is proposed as a means of refining the mapping, with a focus on the differentiation of function within the model space. The approach combines elements of instrumentalism, relativism, Bayesianism and pragmatism, while allowing the realist stance that underlies much of the practice of environmental modelling as a fundamental aim. It may be an interim philosophy that is awaiting developments in measurement technique to allow further refinement, but allows some coherent guidance about how to be specific in presenting predictions to end users.},

abstract = {A set of parameter values for the forest growth model 3-PG was determined. These permit the modelling of the time-course of growth and development of even-aged, intensively-managed, fertilised stands of Eucalyptus globulus. The parameters were determined by fitting output from 3-PG to observed stem biomass data (i.e. total above-ground woody biomass) and canopy leaf area index (LAI). To fit these data, it was necessary to modify 3-PG by making specific leaf area and the fraction of stem biomass in branch and bark explicitly age-dependent, and to include effects of temperature on canopy quantum efficiency. With these parameter values, 3-PG gave a good description of growth at seven of nine disparate sites in Tasmania and Western Australia. A partial explanation for its failure at one site in Western Australia is that this site was subject to a prolonged drought not reflected in the long-term mean climatic data used in this study. At the other, a high altitude site in Tasmania, 3-PG predicted significant growth although extensive frost damage had prevented establishment of a viable canopy. The model was also applied to non-fertilised stands in northern Tasmania for which only basic growth and site data were available. 3-PG adequately predicted the observed peak MAI of the better sites, but over-estimated peak MAI at poor or high-altitude sites. The following conclusions are drawn: 3-PG can provide a good simulation of future growth of intensively-managed, fertilised stands of E. globulus if the model is initialised with observed biomass data at some age around or following canopy closure. If the model is initialised with typical seedling biomass at planting, 3-PG adequately predicts stem growth rate but not canopy LAI. Further development of 3-PG should take into account possible environmental effects on litteffall, the effects of partial canopy closure during early canopy development, and the prediction of mortality prior to the onset of self-thinning. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The stands' mean age and density was 21 years and 940 stems ha -1, respectively and the trees' mean diameter at breast height (DBH) was 25 cm. One simple volume equation with three parameters to be estimated for poplar was constructed with DBH and total height (H) as independent variables. This equation was analyzed and compared to seven published simple equations. The best performance, in terms of low values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Absolute Bias, was achieved by the equations developed by Eriksson and by Scott. However, due to these equations high level of multicollinearity an alternative recommendation was made where the constructed equation is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Organic soils in peatlands store a great propor-tion of the global soil carbon pool and can lose carbon via the atmosphere due to degradation. In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are at-tributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an ex-tensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of $\delta$ 13 C, $\delta$ 15 N, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, $\delta$ 13 C depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper hori-zons. Depth profiles of $\delta$ 15 N differed significantly between sites with increasing $\delta$ 15 N values in the top soil layers paral-leling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in peat decomposition and fertilizer application. At both grass-land sites, the ash content peaked within the first centime-tres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10–60 cm depth. The ash profiles, not only at the managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peat-land was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW < GE < GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of younger peat mate-rial. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification.},

The animals were grouped together on an extensively used permanent fen pasture area with a stock of 0.5 large-animal units (which corresponds to 250 kg of animal living mass) per hectare. Sufficient quantities of fresh grass and hay were available. The results obtained show that the animals maintained their species-specific ingestive behaviour despite common keeping. As compared to fallow deer, the sheep spent markedly longer time with ingestive activities. There were only rare instances of rivalry and conflict (over grazing positions or hay-feeding points) between the two species. The animals of the two groups of species under examination are well adapted to the prevailing climatic conditions. They proved to be able to respond to extreme weather conditions as cold periods and snow storms. It can be rightfully stated that they are able to spend the winter in the open without harm to their health. Outdoor keeping in the winter period can be regarded as suitable for fallow deer and Skudde sheep in northeast Germany.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {Process-based ecosystem models are used increasingly to evaluate the impacts of agricultural practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at various scales. One of the major sources of error and projection uncertainty in these models is the specification of the initial SOC pools sizes. However, few studies have examined errors and uncertainty over time and for various agricultural practices. The main purposes of our study were 1) to examine the impacts of initialization scenarios on CENTURY model V4.5 performance and 2) to quantify the initialization contribution to the total variance of error of the CENTURY model. We simulated the SOC dynamics of six well-characterized long-term experiments (LTEs) with 25 treatments across France, testing various agricultural practices (i.e., inorganic and organic fertilization, various crop rotations and straw and residues removed) using the CENTURY model while keeping the standard parameters unchanged. We applied nine initialization scenarios, each characterized by a unique combination of crop management and relaxation procedures. These relaxation procedures consisted of shifting simulated SOC and nitrogen levels at the end of the initialization period until they matched the stocks at the beginning of the experiment. At the end of the initialization period, the distribution pattern of SOC pools was similar in all scenarios for all LTEs. The slow pool represented the largest proportion of total SOC stocks (average value of 61.5%), whereas the active and passive pools averaged 5.3% and 27.9%, respectively. The overall analysis of CENTURY performance indicated fair results for SOC stocks prediction (R2values of the nine initialization scenarios ranged between 0.50 and 0.75) but weak results for SOC change prediction (R2values of the nine initialization scenarios, ranged between 0.1 and 0.36). The root mean square error (RMSE) values were moderate compared to the total measured SOC stocks and their confidence intervals. The RMSE values ranged between 6.22 Mg ha− 1and 15.24 Mg ha− 1, which corresponded to 13.1% and 32.1% of the initial average total SOC stock for all LTEs, respectively. The highest values were recorded for the no relaxation procedures. CENTURY model errors (i.e., simulated - observed SOC stocks) analysis showed a slight sensitivity to the initialization scenarios (approximately 6% of the total variance of the CENTURY error). However, the second-order interaction of scenarios and LTE contributed by 33.6%. Meanwhile, agricultural practices had the greatest impact on the variance of the CENTURY error (44.7%) compared to other factors. Our findings suggest that the contribution of the initialization to the uncertainty in projected SOC changes is negligible compared to the uncertainty related to the model itself and simulated systems characteristics.},

abstract = {Whole-tree harvest (WTH) may compromise tree productivity and health and lead to soil and surface water acidification. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term change (up to circa 40 years) in soil exchangeable calcium (Ca2+) pools following conventional (CH) and WTH at three Swedish coniferous sites. A second aim was to evaluate how well the results could be reproduced by the dynamic model MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments). Soil Ca2+ pools (down to 20 cm) decreased at all three sites from stand age 15-16 to 37-38 years. The depletion ranged from 2.6 to 8.6 kEq ha-1 (26.5-52.7%) and 0.2 to 5.0 kEq ha-1 (2.3-49.1%) in the CH and WTH treatment, respectively. The presence of an interaction effect indicated that the main effect of time was not statistically significant at all three sites. Over the course of time, soil Ca2+ pools have also become more similar between the CH and WTH treatments, but the Ca2+ pools were still significantly lower (p < 0.05) after WTH at stand age 37-38 years. The measured declines in Ca2+ pools were generally greater than what has been found in other studies and were largely explained by high soil Ca2+ availability and high tree Ca2+ uptake, especially in the CH-plots, as indicated by the MAGIC mass balance budgets. Model simulations by MAGIC partly agreed with the measured data. However, the model exaggerated the soil Ca2+ losses between 1990 and 2013 (CH = 3.6-9.9 kEq ha-1; WTH = 3.0-8.3 kEq ha-1), especially at the spruce sites. Furthermore, MAGIC could not reproduce the rapid diminishing differences between CH and WTH. Uncertainties in model parameters, underestimated soil Ca2+ pools or biological feed-back mechanisms could explain this discrepancy. Until these have been resolved, interpretations of Ca2+ changes related to CH or WTH using dynamic modelling or mass balance budget calculations should be done with caution.},

abstract = {Soil carbon stocks are commonly quantified at fixed depths as the product of soil bulk density, depth and organic carbon (OC) concentration. However, this method systematically overestimates OC stocks in treatments with greater bulk densities such as minimum tillage, exaggerating their benefits. Its use has compromised estimates of OC change where bulk densities differed between treatments or over time periods. We argue that its use should be discontinued and a considerable body of past research re-evaluated. Accurate OC estimations must be based on quantification in equivalent soil masses (ESMs). The objective of this publication is to encourage accurate quantification of changes in OC stocks and other soil properties using ESM procedures by developing a simple procedure to quantify OC in multiple soil layers. We explain errors inherent in fixed depth procedures and show how these errors are eliminated using ESM methods. We describe a new ESM procedure for calculating OC stocks in multiple soil layers and show that it can be implemented without bulk density sampling, which reduces sampling time and facilitates evaluations at greater depths, where bulk density sampling is difficult. A spreadsheet has been developed to facilitate calculations. A sample adjustment procedure is described to facilitate OC quantification in a single equivalent soil mass layer from the surface, when multiple-layer quantification is not necessary.},

abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) may cause more damage than any other species of wildlife. These damages include crop loss, automobile and aviation collisions, disease transmission, environmental degradation, and destruction of ornamental plantings. One practical method of controlling deer damage is the use of exclusionary fences. The relatively high cost of labor and materials required to build effective fences has limited most applications to the protection of orchards, vegetable farms, other high-value resources, and mitigation of human health and safety risks. Improvements in fence technology resulting in less expensive, yet effective fences have expanded the use of fences to manage damage caused by deer. Fences typically installed to manage white-tailed deer damage include wire or plastic mesh, electrified high-tensile steel wire, and electrified polytape or polyrope fence. We reviewed the scientific literature on fencing to determine which fence designs would be the most effective for excluding deer in a variety of situations},

abstract = {Background: Livestock grazing and 'overabundance' of large wild herbivores in forested areas have long been perceived as conflicting with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however, certain kinds of herbivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest ecosystems. Management of grazing/browsing in protected forests can, therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. However, it is not clear what impacts of wild ungulates or livestock are tolerable or desirable in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. The primary aim of the proposed systematic review is to clarify how the diversity of plants and invertebrates is affected by manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose of the review is to investigate whether such manipulation is useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides. Methods: The review will examine primary field studies of how fencing or other kinds of manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates affects plants or invertebrates. We will consider studies made in boreal or temperate forests anywhere in the world, incorporating investigations made not only in protected areas but also in stands under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternative levels of grazing pressure will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include abundance, diversity and composition of plants and invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target species. Relevant studies will mainly be selected from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forest set-asides. A search update will be made with a subset of the search terms used for the systematic map. Searches for additional literature will be made in bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant studies will be subject to critical appraisal and categorised as having high, medium or low susceptibility to bias. Studies with high susceptibility to bias will be excluded from the review. Useful outcomes and data on interventions and other potential effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles. A narrative synthesis will describe the quality and findings of all studies in the review. Where studies report similar outcomes, meta-analysis will be performed. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important and particular component of forest ecosystems and is extremely important to forest health. This review describes the decomposition process, decomposition model and influence factors. CWD decomposition is a complex and continuous process and characterizes many biological and physical processes, including biological respiration, leaching, and fragmentation. All these processes have closed relationships between each other and work synergistically. During decomposition, there are many controlling factors mainly including site conditions (temperature, humidity, and O2/CO2 concentration), woody substrate quality (diameter, species and compound) and organism in CWD. The decomposition rate is generally expresses through a constant k which indicate the percent mass, volume or density loss over time, and can be determined by long-term monitoring, chronosequence approach and the radio between input and the total mass. Now using mathematical models to simulate decomposition patterns and estimate the decomposition rate is widely applied, especially the exponential model. We brought forward that managing and utilizing for the CWD in forest was a primary objective on all forest lands. And it is should be intensified to integrate many related research subjects and to carry a comprehensive, long-term and multi-scale research which mainly focus on seven sections.},

abstract = {Windthrow is all too often looked at as an exceptional, catastrophic phenomenon rather than a recurrent natural disturbance that falls within the spectrum of chronic and acute effects of wind on forests, and that drives eco- system patterns and processes. This paper provides an integrative overview of the nature, contributing factors and impacts of wind-caused disturbance in forests, including its effects on trees, stands, landscapes and soils. Windthrowis examined through the integrating concepts of: the capacity of trees for acclimative growth, the limi- tation of acclimative growth under inter-tree competition, the recurrent nature of severe weather, how terrain and soil conditions affect local stand vulnerability and the effect of recurrent windthrow on stand dynamics and soils. Windthrow management should take place within a framework of general risk management, with evaluation of the likelihood, severity and potential impacts of wind damage considered – with reference to the broad and specific aims of management. There is much to be gained from interdisciplinary communication about the nature and consequences of recurrent wind damage. There are opportunities for climatologists, engineers, ecologists, geomorphologists and others to develop integrative process models at the tree, stand and landscape scales that will improve our collective understanding, and inform management decision-making.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the timber quality of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and European white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) trees in the first and second thinnings in southern parts of Finland, from the viewpoint of sawing of small-diameter, short logs, in particular. The average stem volume of birch was 0.140 m3 in the first thinning stands and 0.206 m3 in the second thinning stands. In planted stands, the trees were larger in the first thinnings but slightly smaller in the second thinnings, compared with naturally regenerated pure birch stands or mixed stands of Norway spruce and birch species. Almost 60% of the harvested and 35% of the remaining stems that could provide saw logs were graded as pulpwood for timber quality due to the occurrence of stem defects. The most common stem defects were multiple crooks and middle crooks. Only minor between-stratum differences were detected in the numbers of defects. Depending on the bucking option, the total percentage of saw and plywood logs from the total birch recovery in the thinning of the sample stands varied between 11.7 and 18.2. The recovery of saw logs was clearly higher in the second thinnings, 12-19%, than in the first thinnings, 8-14%. Of the stand types, saw log recovery was the highest in planted birch stands, 12-19%, but lower in naturally regenerated pure birch stands and mixed stands of Norway spruce and birch. The highest share of saw logs was in the second thinning of planted stands, 17-25%. This study shows that the harvesting recoveries of end-use based timber assortments can be estimated in different kinds of thinning birch stands. Based on tree and log dimensions and stem squality, silver birch firstly from plantations and secondly from mixed stands should be the most interesting source of raw material for the saw milling, furniture and interior product sectors.},

Conversely, the SMEs that displayed less sustainable environmental management practices were all run by managers at conventional stages of development. Drawing upon diverse examples of environmental leadership, this paper analyzes the reasons why the stages of post-conventional consciousness development of top managers seem to foster corporate greening in SMEs.

abstract = {Roads increase risk to animals via direct and indirect mechanisms yet, both positive and negative effects of animal space use in relation to roads have been reported. These contrasting reports may not actually represent animal ecology, but could be a product of the primary variable used to test the relationship between animals and roads. Animal-road associations are often evaluated using Euclidean distance. Euclidean, or straight-line, distance fails to account for the screening effects of vegetation and topography and may document spurious relationships. We evaluated the influence of Euclidean distance, visibility from road and forage quality on summer space use for male elk Cervus elaphus and female elk subherds in Custer State Park, South Dakota, USA. Models that included interactions with visibility from road metrics outperformed models that included only Euclidean distance to road as main effects. Elk response to roads varied by sex and road type, which functioned as an index for vehicle use. Male elk selected habitat away from roads with the greatest vehicle use, an effect that was greater if habitat was visible from those roads. Female elk tended to select habitat with high forage quality in areas visible from roads closed to vehicle use. Interestingly, both male and female elk selected habitat away from roads with secondary vehicle use and near to roads devoid of traffic, regardless of visibility. Our analysis highlights the importance of including both Euclidean distance and visibility from road metrics. Road effects research may be incomplete without consideration of visibility from roads, particularly for large mammals in landscapes with intense road use.},

abstract = {The current review investigates the hypothesis that dormant soil microorganisms are relevant for microbial processes and community changes. Dormant soil microorganisms are C limited and do not grow. However, they still have a basic metabolism, which requires organic C uptake, resulting in a slow biomass turnover. Dormant soil microorganisms respond to substrate limitation by recycling own cell components and by down-regulating enzyme-expressing genes. The adsorption of microbial cells to clay and soil organic matter, intensified by limited water availability under unsaturated conditions, reduces microbial requirements for maintenance energy but causes immobility. For this reason, soil microorganisms cannot move rapidly towards places of demand for a certain microbial ability. Consequently, it can be assumed that subsoils and deeper vadose zone sediments must have been predominantly colonized by microorganisms during periods near to the surface, with access to autotrophic C inputs. Being remote from hotspots of C input, dormant microorganisms are an important reservoir of biodiversity and potential activity if an organic substrate arrives. The turnover of the whole microbial biomass C (MBC) is the product of C use efficiency (CUE) and a maintenance coefficient. For complex osmotrophic soil microbial communities, the CUE accounts for all biomass and metabolites synthesized during growth, i.e. especially exo-enzymes but also extracellular polymeric substances. This results in a mean CUE of 0.59 for easily soluble glucose and sucrose components and a mean CUE of 0.45 for more complex organic polymers such as cellulose, straw and MBC. The annual C input limits the MBC turnover time, which varies roughly around 365 days, assuming a CUE of 0.4 for soil organic matter.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics on a blanket bog (at Pollagoona) and a raised bog (at Scohaboy) in Ireland after felling of plantation forestry and rewetting, and to produce annual balances for each gas at both sites. Gas fluxes were measured during a twelve-month period using the chamber method. Microsite types reflecting the dominant plant species at the chamber plots were identified and classified as Eriophorum-Sphagnum, Cladonia-Calluna and Molinia at Pollagoona and Eriophorum-Sphagnum, Cladonia-mosses, Eriophorum and brash (logging residues) at Scohaboy. The relationships between gas fluxes and environmental variables were assessed, and regression models were used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 gas balances for each microsite type. Annual estimates of N2O exchange were calculated using seasonal means. Over the course of the study both sites acted as CO2 and CH4 sources. Although Pollagoona was an overall net source of CO2-C (131.6 ± 298.3 g m-2 yr-1), one microsite type (Cladonia-Calluna) acted as a strong sink for CO2-C (-142.8 g m-2 yr-1). Molinia microsites exhibited the highest CH4-C emissions (2.53 ± 1.01 g m-2 yr-1). Nitrous oxide emissions at Pollagoona were calculated as 12 $\mu$g m-2 yr-1. Scohaboy acted as a large CO2-C source (585.3 ± 241.5 g m-2 yr-1) (all microsite types) despite re-vegetation of non-brash plots, due to the availability of fresh organic matter across the site. Scohaboy was also a CH4-C source, emitting 3.25 ± 0.58 g m-2 yr-1. Emissions of both CO2-C (819.31 ± 57.7 g m-2 yr-1) and CH4-C (4.76 ± 0.98 g m-2 yr-1) were highest from the brash plots. Annual N2O-N emissions were small over the study period (72 µg m-2 yr-1). Our results indicate that, despite remedial work being conducted on both peatlands to raise the water table, the C sink function has not yet been restored at either site.},

abstract = {Leaf litter and deadwood have important roles in the forest ecosystems, providing shelter for several organisms, preventing erosion and microclimate fluctuations. Their decomposition is a key process of biogeochemical cycles in forest. Microorganisms are the primary agents of decomposition. Particularly, fungi are considered the major contributors due to their ability to produce specific enzymes and the possibility to access new substrates through hyphae. In this review, we highlighted the role of fungi in decomposition and reconsider the role of bacteria, neglected in the past, identifying key research needs and knowledge. Particular attention is given to the succession of different taxa with different ecological role that are able to use a substrate that undergoes to chemical and structural modifications. The quality of substrates is a critical factor that influences the microbial community together with environmental variables, such as temperature and moisture. However, the microbial community is also able to influence the substrate characteristics. Litter nitrogen content is influenced by the uptake of exogenous N by decomposers to meet their metabolic requirements. The complex interactions among microbial communities, ecosystem attributes and chemical composition of fine litter and woody debris remain unclear and almost exclusively referred to boreal and temperate forests.},

abstract = {Adenylate (i.e. adenosine tri- (ATP), di- (ADP) and monophosphates (AMP)) and microbial biomass C data were collected over a wide range of sites including forest floor layers and forest, grassland and arable soils. Microbial biomass C was measured by fumigation extraction and adenylates after alkaline Na3PO4/DMSO/EDTA extraction and HPLC detection. Our aims were (1) to test whether the sum of adenylates is a better estimate for microbial biomass than the determination of ATP, (2) to compare our conversion values with those proposed by others, and (3) to analyse whether soil properties or land use form affect the relationships between ATP, adenylates and microbial biomass C. A close relationship was found between microbial biomass C and ATP (r = 0.96), but also with the sum of adenylates (r = 0.96) within all appropriately conditioned soil samples (n = 112). In the mineral soil (n = 98), the geometric means of the ATP-to-microbial biomass C ratio and the adenylates-to-microbial biomass C ratio were 7.4 and 11.4 $\mu$mol g-1, respectively. The mean ratios did not differ significantly between the different texture classes and land use forms. In the forest floor, the ATP-to-microbial biomass C ratio and the adenylates-to-microbial biomass C ratio were both roughly two-thirds of those of the mineral soil. The average adenylate energy charge (AEC) of all soil samples was 0.79 and showed a strong negative relationship with the soil pH (r = -0.69). However, the AEC is presumably only indirectly affected by the soil pH. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In agroecosystems where crops are planted in a specific design (row crops), sampling procedures for root biomass quantification need to consider the spatial variability of the root system. This article explains in detail how to sample and calculate root biomass considering the sampling position in the field and the differential weight of the root biomass in the inter-row compared to the crop row when expressing data per area unit. This method is highly reproducible in the field and requires no expensive equipment and/or special skills. It proposes to use a narrow auger thus reducing field labor with less destructive sampling, and decreases laboratory time because samples are smaller. The small sample size also facilitates the washing and root separation with tweezers. This method is suitable for either winter- or summer crop roots. •Description of a direct field method for row-crop root measurements.•Description of data calculation for total root-biomass estimation per unit area.•The proposed method is simple, less labor- and less time consuming.},

The low confidence engendered in feedback projections is reduced further by the common representation in models of an outdated knowledge of soil carbon turnover. ‘Model-knowledge integration' — representing in models an advanced understanding of soil carbon stabilization — is the first step to build confidence. This will inform experiments that further increase confidence by resolving competing mechanisms that most influence projected soil-carbon stocks.

abstract = {A theory comprising two basic concepts relating nutrition and growth is presented. The first concept is a nutrient flux model and is based upon studies of plants at constant internal nutrient concentrations, where a formal mathematical derivation shows that the relative uptake rate (RU) and the relative growth rate (RG) are equal. Deviations from equality are results of experimental insufficiencies and errors. The second concept is based on the observation that RG is linearly related to the internal nutrient concentration. The slope represents nutrient productivity (Pn), an important parameter expressing growth rate per unit of nutrient. Light and the plant genome, for example, influence the value of the proportionality factor, Pn, but not the formal relationship between the internal nutrient concentration and RG Not only the theory itself but many results and conclusions are very different from those obtained with traditional methods. In experiments where RU was controlled during the exponential period of growth, the relationships between treatment (the relative addition rate, RA), nutrient uptake (RU) and growth (RG) were reproduced with extremely low variability. In agreement with theory, internal nutrient concentration and RG remained stable over time (steady-state). An extension of the theory is based upon the empirical assumption that after exponential growth, self-shading and ageing reduce Pn in proportion to biomass. This assumption has been successfully applied in predicting growth of forest stands, but the nature of the growth reduction is little understood. The generalized model has few parameters and can easily be rewritten to suit different experimental aims, for example to establish reference values and to model changes in soil fertility. Further extension and understanding of the model and different interpretations of the parameters are discussed.},

In business-as-usual management, the intensity of thinnings (from below) and single-tree selective cuttings followed those recommended for even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged management (BSC) in practical forestry in Finland. Moreover, higher or lower basal area thresholds, and shorter or longer production cycles, were used in simulations. We found that, the mean annual carbon uptake, volume growth, and carbon stock in trees and harvested timber, were nearly the same under even-aged (BT) and uneven-aged (BSC) management, when assuming full seed crop in latter one. However, the carbon stock in the soil and ecosystem and the mean annual net ecosystem exchange were slightly smaller under BT. The carbon retention time was longer under BSC. The net present value (NPV with interest rate of 3 per cent) of timber production was clearly lower under BT, when the calculation was initiated at planting on clear-cutting area, in opposite to when initiating calculation a few years before the second thinning. Higher basal area thresholds and longer production cycles increased carbon stocks, carbon retention and timber yield, regardless of management system. On the other hand, the results of uneven-aged management (BSC) were very sensitive to the success of natural regeneration and ingrowth of seedlings, as a reduction of the seed crop by 25-75 per cent from the full seed crop decreases the volume growth by 44-74 per cent and timber yield up to 46 per cent.},

abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway by which fixed carbon in the biosphere is returned to the atmosphere, yet there are limits to our ability to predict respiration rates using environmental drivers at the global scale. While temperature, moisture, carbon supply and other site characteristics are known to regulate soil respiration rates at plot scales within certain biomes, quantitative frameworks for evaluating the relative importance of these factors across different biomes and at the global scale require tests of the relationships between field estimates and global climatic data. This study evaluates the factors driving Rs at the global scale by linking global datasets of soil moisture, soil temperature, primary productivity and soil carbon estimates with observations of annual Rs from the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB). We find that calibrating models with parabolic soil moisture functions can improve predictive power over similar models with asymptotic functions of mean annual precipitation. Soil temperature is comparable with previously-reported air temperature observations used in predicting Rs, and is the dominant driver of Rs in global models; however, within certain biomes soil moisture or soil carbon emerge as dominant predictors of Rs. We identify regions where typical temperature-driven responses are further mediated by soil moisture, precipitation, and carbon supply and regions in which environmental controls on high Rs values are difficult to ascertain due to limited field data. Because soil moisture integrates temperature and precipitation dynamics, it can more directly constrain the heterotrophic component of Rs, but global-scale models tend to smooth its spatial heterogeneity by aggregating factors that increase moisture variability within and across biomes. We compare statistical and mechanistic models that provide independent estimates of global Rs ranging from 83 to 108 Pg/yr, but also highlight regions of uncertainty where more observations are required or environmental controls are hard to constrain.},

abstract = {The role of soil organic carbon in global carbon cycles is receiving increasing attention both as a potentially large and uncertain source of CO2 emissions in response to predicted global temperature rises, and as a natural sink for carbon able to reduce atmospheric CO2. There is general agreement that the technical potential for sequestration of carbon in soil is significant, and some consensus on the magnitude of that potential. Croplands worldwide could sequester between 0.90 and 1.85 Pg C/yr, i.e. 26–53% of the target of the “4p1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate”. The importance of intensively cultivated regions such as North America, Europe, India and intensively cultivated areas in Africa, such as Ethiopia, is highlighted. Soil carbon sequestration and the conservation of existing soil carbon stocks, given its multiple benefits including improved food production, is an important mitigation pathway to achieve the less than 2 °C global target of the Paris Climate Agreement.},

abstract = {The air temperature (Tair), total precipitation (TP) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) are standard input data for soil carbon dynamic models, i.e., for calculating temperature and moisture effects on soil biological activity. The resolution needed depends on objectives, the complexity of models and inbuilt pedotransfer functions. The Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) soil climate front end model calculates a multiplicative soil-temperature (re_temp) and -moisture (re_wat) factor with a daily time-step to estimate soil biological activity, i.e., re_crop=re_temp??re_wat. Our objective was to determine how much re_temp, re_wat and re_crop are affected by low-pass filtering of the climatic input data for a cool, humid temperate region. To achieve this we conducted spectral analysis on Tair, TP, PET and re_crop in the frequency domain. Thereafter we applied Fourier low-pass filters of 5, 15, 30, 60 and 180 days on Tair, TP, PET and tracked their effects through the soil climate model's state variables and outputs. This was done using a sandy and a heavy clay soil and an 89-year daily time-series from a meteorological station in Quebec (Canada). The Fourier spectra showed that the variance for Tair, PET and re_crop was dominated by an annual cycle, as could be expected. There was no yearly cycle for TP. The variation in re_temp explained most of the variance in re_crop. The soil climate module outputs were not sensitive to low-pass filtering of PET. A daily time-step was needed to avoid overestimating re_crop for the sandy soil. Using a weekly time-step for TP and Tair allowed us to explain about 80% of the variance in re_crop for the heavy clay soil. This study also indicates that the standard leaf (and green) area index functions for calculating transpiration should receive more attention, since they have significant effects on the state and output variables. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dead trees, particularly downed logs, play an important role in the dynamics of forest ecosystem. Contribution of decaying wood to C and nutrient pools of forest soils depends on the tree species and degree of wood decay. However, the extent to which the downed logs affect the soil properties of temperate forests has rarely been evaluated. In this study, a mixed beech forest was selected in Liresar region of Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, to investigate if and how the presence of downed logs affected soil quality and function by comparing soils underneath degraded logs and nearby soils of the two dominant tree species (beech and hornbeam). We then explored how these effects occurred as downed logs decomposed by comparing the woods of both tree species at four degrees of decomposition. Degree of decay of downed logs was classified into four classes (DC1–DC4). Eight dead trees of each tree species were selected at the center of each sample plot. Three composite soil samples underneath each decaying log and 100 cm away from a decaying log were collected at two soil depths (0–15 and 15–30 cm) to analyze soil main physicochemical properties and microbial activity. The results revealed that downed logs affected soil physical (5% wetter than control soils), chemical (2% lower pH, 100% increase in organic C and total N in the case of hornbeam, and 2% increase in P), and biological characteristics (soil microbial respiration enhanced by 10%, and microbial biomass C 620 and 351.5 mg kg−1 and microbial biomass N 66.47 and 32.18 mg kg−1, respectively, in the cases of beech and hornbeam), thus resulting in significantly different soil microsites from those without downed logs. Presence of downed logs increased soil microbial activity and soil fertility as wood decayed. Thus, the presence of downed logs is an important factor influencing forest soils and should be taken into consideration in forest management practices.},

abstract = {In many parts of Europe and North America, populations of large mammals and birds have recovered during recent decades. In Sweden, this has resulted in more wildlife than was historically recorded. This positive development provides a number of opportunities for ecosystem services and for biodiversity. More wildlife also means more interactions with humans, as many birds and mammals may interfere with human interests in the landscape, such as natural resource use. Thus, more wildlife may shift the baseline for societal perception of wildlife. Wildlife species may host pathogens with potential for infecting humans and domestic animals. With increasing knowledge about zoonotic diseases and their dynamics, more scientific, media, and public attention is given to zoonotic processes. We are concerned with how the public image of the wild animals is affected, because many of the recent zoonotic outbreaks connect animal groups to diseases such as avian and swine influenza, lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis. The societal focus on zoonotic diseases may increase the fear of the wild and will separate the public further from the outdoors in general and wildlife in particular. Ultimately, we risk a juxtaposition of the overall acceptance of biological diversity and a shifting societal perception of wildlife that could be harmful for life on earth. We therefore suggest multidisciplinary research on societal awareness of zoonotic diseases and its implications for public acceptance for wildlife and biological diversity. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Methane (CH \n                        4) production varies greatly among different types of peatlands along an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic hydrogeomorphic gradient. pH is thought to be a dominant control over observed differences in CH \n                        4 production across sites, and previous pH manipulation experiments have verified the inhibitory effect of low pH on CH \n                        4 production. In this experiment, we asked (i) if the major effect of low pH is direct inhibition of one or both pathways of methanogenesis and/or inhibition of 'upstream' fermentation that provides substrates for methanogens, and (ii) to what extent is pH sufficient to explain differences in CH \n                        4 production relative to other factors that co-vary across the gradient. To address these questions, we adjusted the pH of peat slurries from 6 peatlands to 4 levels (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5) that reflected their range of native pH, maintained these pH levels over a 43-day anaerobic laboratory incubation, and measured a suite of responses within the anaerobic carbon cycle. Higher pH caused a significant increase in CO \n                        2 production in all sites. Regardless of site, time, and pH level, the reduction of inorganic electron acceptors contributed to <12% of total CO \n                        2 production. Higher pH caused acetate pooling by Day 7, but this effect was greater in the more ombrotrophic sites and lasted throughout the incubation, whereas acetate was almost completely consumed as a substrate for acetoclastic methanogenesis by Day 43 in the minerotrophic sites. Higher pH also enhanced CH \n                        4 production and this process was up to 436% more sensitive to changes in pH than CO \n                        2 production. However, across all sites and pH levels, CH \n                        4 production accounted for <25% of the total gaseous C production. Fermentation appeared to be the main pathway for anaerobic C mineralization. Our results indicate that low pH inhibits CH \n                        4 production through direct inhibition of both methanogenesis pathways and indirectly through its effects on fermentation, but the direct effects are stronger. The inability of acetoclastic methanogenesis to fully compensate for acetate pooling in ombrotrophic peats at higher pH suggests that CH \n                        4 production is inhibited by some factor(s) in addition to pH in these sites. We examine a variety of other potential inhibitory mechanisms and postulate that humic substances may provide an important inhibitory effect over CH \n                        4 production in ombrotrophic peatlands. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ecological dose (ED50) of Cd on alkaline and acid phosphatase activity and the ATP content of three contrasting forest soils was measured with or without Cu and Zn to assess the additive toxic effects of these two metals. Soils polluted with Cu and/or Zn were treated with increasing Cd concentrations to give the following metal combinations: Cd, Cd + Cu, Cd + Zn and Cd + Cu + Zn. Alkaline and acid phosphatase activities and ATP content of the three soils were analysed 4 h, 7 and 28 days after the metal additions. The ED50 values were obtained by interpolating the enzyme activities or ATP data with a kinetic model and the goodness of fit was satisfactory. Generally, the ED50 values of both acid and alkaline phosphatase activities for Cd were lower (higher toxicity) with than without Cu and Zn and the effect of Cu and Zn was particularly adverse when these two metals were both added to soils. The alkaline phosphatase was more sensitive in the acid and neutral soil whereas the acid phosphatase was more sensitive in the alkaline soil. Both phosphatase activities and the ATP content were more sensitive in the sandy than in the finer textured soils. The ATP content was less sensitive to the additive effects. Increasing toxicity was observed during the incubation. Analysis of 1 M NH4NO3-extractable Cd, Cu and Zn revealed that Cd competed with Zn for the adsorption sites but not with Cu. However, the lower ED50 values for Cd of the two phosphatase activities and of the ATP content in the presence of heavy metal combinations could be not explained by the heavy metal solubility data. It is concluded that the ED50 may be a sensitive tool for assessing additve toxic effects to soil biochemical parameters. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach using basal peat ages and carbon (C) accumulation profiles from the world's major peatland regions to decompose C flux terms from time-dependent C pool data observed from peat cores. Our peat-data syntheses show that the total peat C pools are 547 GtC, 50 GtC, and 15 GtC for northern, tropical and southern peatlands, respectively. The modeled net C balance (NCB) has a mean value of 41.8 TgC/yr for northern peatlands during the Holocene, ranging from 83.1 TgC/yr in the early Holocene around 9 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP) to 21.5 TgC/yr around 2 ka, a temporal pattern mostly owing to the delayed effect of long-term decay of previously accumulated peat C. NCB from tropical and southern peatlands represents much smaller terms, mostly less than 10 TgC/yr. Northern peatlands represent about 90% of global total peatland C pool of 612 GtC and > 90% of global peatland NCB. Our bottom-up global peatland synthesis indicates a decrease in rates of peatland area expansion and reduced CH4 emissions during the late Holocene, thus lending support for an anthropogenic source of late-Holocene CH4 rise. The C balance analysis of global peatland data indicates a cumulative net C uptake of 272 GtC in the early Holocene (11-7 ka), 151 GtC at 7-4 ka, and 116 GtC after 4 ka. The large cumulative fluxes and significant variations throughout the Holocene could greatly contribute to the observed atmospheric CO2 and delta 13CO2 patterns derived from Antarctic ice cores. Thus, global mass-balance calculations or climate-carbon cycle simulations have to consider these large net C uptake terms from global peatlands and their variations over the Holocene.},

The microbial response to three substrate amendment rates (0.0, 0.05, and 2.0 mg glucose-C g−1 soil) was examined using: 13C and 18O isotope tracing approaches which estimate CUE based on substrate uptake and growth dynamics; calorespirometry which infers growth and CUE from metabolic heat and respiration rates; metabolic flux analysis where CUE is determined as the balance between biosynthesis and respiration using position-specific 13CO2 production of labeled glucose; and stoichiometric modeling which derives CUE from elemental ratios of microbial biomass, substrate, and exoenzyme activity. The CUE estimates we obtained differed by method and substrate concentration, ranging under in situ conditions from <0.4 for the substrate-nonspecific methods that do not use C tracers (18O, stoichiometric modeling) to >0.6 for the substrate-specific methods that trace glucose use (13C method, calorespirometry, metabolic flux analysis). We explore the different aspects of microbial metabolism that each method captures and how this affects the interpretation of CUE estimates. We recommend that users consider the strengths and weaknesses of each method when choosing the technique that will best address their research needs.},

Pyrogenic organic carbon (PyOC) derived from incomplete burning of biomass is considered the most persistent fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC), being expected to remain in soil for centuries. However, PyOC persistence has seldom been evaluated under field conditions. Based on a unique set of soils from five European long-term bare fallows (LTBF), i.e., vegetation-free field experiments, we provide the first direct comparison between PyOC and SOC persistence in temperate arable soils. We found that soil PyOC contents decreased more rapidly than expected from current concepts, the mean residence time (MRT) of native PyOC being just 1.6 times longer than that of SOC. At the oldest experimental site, 55% of the initial PyOC remained after 80 years of bare fallow. Our results suggest that while the potential for long-term C storage exists, the persistence of PyOC in soil may currently be overestimated.},

abstract = {For grain crops, harvest index (HI) is the ratio of harvested grain to total shoot dry matter, and this can be used as a measure of reproductive efficiency. The index can also be used to estimate crop carbon (C) balances by applying it to grain yield statistics to determine total shoot dry matter and then calculating crop residues as the difference between shoot C and grain C. Such an approach is widely used in C-accounting systems. Such a C-accounting practice is sensitive to changes in HI. In Australia, measured variations in HI are large enough to alter C balance calculations for some crops. Much of this variation results from the diverse range of climates and soils, which are a feature of the Australian cereal cropping region. Factors that influence crop HI include the energy and protein content of seeds, long-term breeding achievements, and extreme (either hot or cold) temperatures during crop reproductive development. Crop husbandry can also influence HI, especially delayed sowing, which shortens the length of the vegetative phase and increases HI. For wheat, and perhaps some other C3 cereals, excess nitrogen can enhance the allocation of photosynthate to structural carbon, which cannot bemobilized to grain later, resulting in a decrease in HI. Evidence for the balance between pre and postanthesis water use of field-grown crops having a significant influence on crop HI is equivocal. A dataset containing more than 3000 estimates of HI in Australia has been assembled and used to summarize observed HI variations for each of the principal field crops grown in Australia. There remains a need for more reliable field HI data to be used in C-accounting systems and to aid the development of models to simulate likely regional and seasonal differences in HI for C-accounting purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The field of soil ecology has relatively few fundamental unifying principles that can be used to explain and predict patterns and processes in belowground ecosystems. Here we propose that a first step towards developing a more comprehensive set of unifying principles in soil ecology is to identify and understand the characteristics shared by a wide range of soils, the common mechanisms driving soil biogeochemical processes, and the biogeochemical constraints imposed on soil biota regardless of soil type. Very often, soil ecologists focus on the differences between soils when, in fact, many soils share a common set of ecological mechanisms that govern biogeochemical processes. Here we explore evidence for the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology, highlighting some of the similarities in carbon dynamics and soil communities across widely different soil types and examining the various mechanisms that may drive these similarities. Given that soils are extremely complex environments that exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, defining overarching principles is, arguably, more challenging in soil ecology than in other disciplines. However, recent methodological advances hold great promise for testing and formulating unifying principles, particularly when such methods are used consistently, in concert with other interdisciplinary approaches, and across a range of sites. Soils are not identical, but they do exhibit consistent patterns and processes that, if explored more intensively, will affirm the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Animals translocate nutrients by consuming nutrients at one point and excreting them or dying at another location. Such lateral fluxes may be an important mechanism of nutrient supply in many ecosystems, but lack quantification and a systematic theoretical framework for their evaluation. This paper presents a mathematical framework for quantifying such fluxes in the context of mammalian herbivores. We develop an expression for lateral diffusion of a nutrient, where the diffusivity is a biologically determined parameter depending on the characteristics of mammals occupying the domain, including size-dependent phenomena such as day range, metabolic demand, food passage time, and population size. Three findings stand out: (a) Scaling law-derived estimates of diffusion parameters are comparable to estimates calculated from estimates of each coefficient gathered from primary literature. (b) The diffusion term due to transport of nutrients in dung is orders of magnitude large than the coefficient representing nutrients in bodymass. (c) The scaling coefficients show that large herbivores make a disproportionate contribution to lateral nutrient transfer. We apply the diffusion equation to a case study of Kruger National Park to estimate the conditions under which mammal-driven nutrient transport is comparable in magnitude to other (abiotic) nutrient fluxes (inputs and losses). Finally, a global analysis of mammalian herbivore transport is presented, using a comprehensive database of contemporary animal distributions. We show that continents vary greatly in terms of the importance of animal-driven nutrient fluxes, and also that perturbations to nutrient cycles are potentially quite large if threatened large herbivores are driven to extinction.},

abstract = {Aiming at an improved understanding of the conditional nature of soil organic matter stability, we present an overview of (1) biotic strategies and (2) ecological processes by which decomposer organisms gain access to, or are prevented from metabolising soil organic resources. The biotic strategies discussed comprise well-known activities, such as the release of exo-enzymes, the mechanical crushing of organic residues, the bioturbation of soil mass, and the fixation of carbon in the living biomass. The ecological processes described have received less attention regarding their importance in prolonging the persistence of soil organic matter. Model calculations illustrate that cell energy demand forces micro-organisms to operate at low decomposition rates, and that diffusion losses inhibit microbial growth and impede the formation of new microbial colonies. The specialisation of decomposer organisms towards particular microhabitats and substrates gives rise to refuges where organic resources are temporarily not accessed. We derive four stability criteria, by which we classify organic matter pools: passive versus active stabilisation, and partial versus absolute refuge. Two case studies confirm that in temperate soils a dominant quantity of organic material resides in the passive stabilisation/partial refuge status and persists in spite of being accessible and decomposable. We conclude that soil organic matter is stabilised by a complex of mechanisms that constrain decomposition rates, several of which are not based on substrate quality or soil conditions, but on the biology of the decomposing soil organisms. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Decreasing RSRs with mean annual temperature (MAT) were found in the whole dataset as well as in three separate forest types (coniferous forests, deciduous broadleaved forests and evergreen broadleaved forests) and three genera (Cunninghamia, Pinus and Quercus). However, RSRs showed different trends with mean annual precipitation (MAP) across different groups including: a U-shaped pattern for coniferous forests, Larix forest and Pinus forest covering wide MAP ranges; a decreasing trend for deciduous broadleaved forests and Quercus forest covering ranges with low MAP; and no trend for evergreen broadleaved forest and Cunninghamia forest covering ranges with high MAP.

abstract = {Soil organic carbon management has the potential to aid climate change mitigation through drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide. To be effective, such management must account for processes influencing carbon storage and re-emission at different space and time scales. Achieving this requires a conceptual advance in our understanding to link carbon dynamics from the scales at which processes occur to the scales at which decisions are made. Here, we propose that soil carbon persistence can be understood through the lens of decomposers as a result of functional complexity derived from the interplay between spatial and temporal variation of molecular diversity and composition. For example, co-location alone can determine whether a molecule is decomposed, with rapid changes in moisture leading to transport of organic matter and constraining the fitness of the microbial community, while greater molecular diversity may increase the metabolic demand of, and thus potentially limit, decomposition. This conceptual shift accounts for emergent behaviour of the microbial community and would enable soil carbon changes to be predicted without invoking recalcitrant carbon forms that have not been observed experimentally. Functional complexity as a driver of soil carbon persistence suggests soil management should be based on constant care rather than one-time action to lock away carbon in soils. Dynamic interactions between chemical and biological controls govern the stability of soil organic carbon and drive complex, emergent patterns in soil carbon persistence.},

abstract = {[1] Here we present a new data synthesis of global peatland ages, area changes, and carbon (C) pool changes since the Last Glacial Maximum, along with a new peatland map and total C pool estimates. The data show different controls of peatland expansion and C accumulation in different regions. We estimate that northern peatlands have accumulated 547 (473–621) GtC, showing maximum accumulation in the early Holocene in response to high summer insolation and strong summer – winter climate seasonality. Tropical peatlands have accumulated 50 (44–55) GtC, with rapid rates about 8000–4000 years ago affected by a high and more stable sea level, a strong summer monsoon, and before the intensification of El Ni{\~{n}}o. Southern peatlands, mostly in Patagonia, South America, have accumulated 15 (13–18) GtC, with rapid accumulation during the Antarctic Thermal Maximum in the late glacial, and during the mid‐Holocene thermal maximum. This is the first comparison of peatland dynamics among these global regions. Our analysis shows that a diversity of drivers at different times have significantly impacted the global C cycle, through the contribution of peatlands to atmospheric CH4 budgets and the history of peatland CO2 exchange with the atmosphere.

abstract = {The large uncertainty in soil carbon--climate feedback predictions has been attributed to the incorrect parameterization of decomposition temperature sensitivity (Q10; ref. 1) and microbial carbon use efficiency2. Empirical experiments have found that these parameters vary spatiotemporally3, 4, 5, 6, but such variability is not included in current ecosystem models7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we use a thermodynamically based decomposition model to test the hypothesis that this observed variability arises from interactions between temperature, microbial biogeochemistry, and mineral surface sorptive reactions. We show that because mineral surfaces interact with substrates, enzymes and microbes, both Q10 and microbial carbon use efficiency are hysteretic (so that neither can be represented by a single static function) and the conventional labile and recalcitrant substrate characterization with static temperature sensitivity is flawed. In a 4-K temperature perturbation experiment, our fully dynamic model predicted more variable but weaker soil carbon--climate feedbacks than did the static Q10 and static carbon use efficiency model when forced with yearly, daily and hourly variable temperatures. These results imply that current Earth system models probably overestimate the response of soil carbon stocks to global warming. Future ecosystem models should therefore consider the dynamic interactions between sorptive mineral surfaces, substrates and microbial processes.},

abstract = {Soils of temperate forests store significant amounts of organic matter and are considered to be net sinks of atmospheric CO2. Soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover has been studied using the ?14C values of bulk SOC or different SOC fractions as observational constraints in SOC models. Further, the ?14C values of CO2 that evolved during the in- cubation of soil and roots have been widely used together with ?14C of total soil respiration to partition soil respira- tion into heterotrophic respiration (HR) and rhizosphere res- piration. However, these data have not been used as joint observational constraints to determine SOC turnover times. Thus, we focus on (1) how different combinations of ob- servational constraints help to narrow estimates of turnover times and other parameters of a simple two-pool model, the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM); (2) whether re- laxing the steady-state assumption in a multiple constraints approach allows the source/sink strength of the soil to be de- termined while estimating turnover times at the same time. To this end ICBM was adapted to model SOC and SO14C in parallel with litterfall and the ?14C of litterfall as driv- ing variables. The ?14C of the atmosphere with its promi- nent bomb peak was used as a proxy for the ?14C of lit- terfall. Data from three spruce-dominated temperate forests in Germany and the USA (Coulissenhieb II, Solling D0 and Howland Tower site) were used to estimate the parameters of ICBM via Bayesian calibration. Key findings are as fol- lows: (1) the joint use of all four observational constraints (SOC stock and its ?14C, HR flux and its ?14C) helped to considerably narrow turnover times of the young pool (pri- marily by ?14C of HR) and the old pool (primarily by ?14C of SOC). Furthermore, the joint use of all observational con- straints made it possible to constrain the humification factor in ICBM, which describes the fraction of the annual outflux from the young pool that enters the old pool. The Bayesian parameter estimation yielded the following turnover times (mean±standard deviation) for SOC in the young pool: Coulissenhieb II 1.1±0.5 years, Solling D0 5.7±0.8 years and Howland Tower 0.8±0.4 years. Turnover times for the old pool were 377±61 years (Coulissenhieb II), 313±66 years (Solling D0) and 184±42 years (Howland Tower), re- spectively. (2) At all three sites the multiple constraints ap- proach was not able to determine if the soil has been los- ing or storing carbon. Nevertheless, the relaxed steady-state assumption hardly introduced any additional uncertainty for the other parameter estimates. Overall the results suggest that using ?14C data from more than one carbon pool or flux helps to better constrain SOC models.},

abstract = {<p>Land-surface models (LSMs) are increasingly called upon to represent not only the exchanges of energy, water and momentum across the land–atmosphere interface (their original purpose in climate models), but also how ecosystems and water resources respond to climate, atmospheric environment, land-use and land-use change, and how these responses in turn influence land–atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), trace gases and other species that affect the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere. However, the LSMs embedded in state-of-the-art climate models differ in how they represent fundamental aspects of the hydrological and carbon cycles, resulting in large inter-model differences and sometimes faulty predictions. These "third-generation" LSMs respect the close coupling of the carbon and water cycles through plants, but otherwise tend to be under-constrained, and have not taken full advantage of robust hydrological parameterizations that were independently developed in offline models. Benchmarking, combining multiple sources of atmospheric, biospheric and hydrological data, should be a required component of LSM development, but this field has been relatively poorly supported and intermittently pursued. Moreover, benchmarking alone is not sufficient to ensure that models improve. Increasing complexity may increase realism but decrease reliability and robustness, by increasing the number of poorly known model parameters. In contrast, simplifying the representation of complex processes by stochastic parameterization (the representation of unresolved processes by statistical distributions of values) has been shown to improve model reliability and realism in both atmospheric and land-surface modelling contexts. We provide examples for important processes in hydrology (the generation of runoff and flow routing in heterogeneous catchments) and biology (carbon uptake by species-diverse ecosystems). We propose that the way forward for next-generation complex LSMs will include: (a) representations of biological and hydrological processes based on the implementation of multiple internal constraints; (b) systematic application of benchmarking and data assimilation techniques to optimize parameter values and thereby test the structural adequacy of models; and (c) stochastic parameterization of unresolved variability, applied in both the hydrological and the biological domains.</p>},

abstract = {The conventional soil organic matter (SOM) decay paradigm considers the intrinsic quality of SOM as the dominant decay limitation with the result that it is modelled using simple first-order decay kinetics. This view and modelling approach is often criticized for being too simplistic and unreliable for predictive purposes. It is still under debate if first-order models can correctly capture the variability in temporal SOM decay observed between different agroecosystems and climates. To address this question, we calibrated a first-order model (Q) on six long-term bare fallow field experiments across Europe. Following conventional SOM decay theory, we assumed that parameters directly describing SOC decay (rate of SOM quality change and decomposer metabolism) are thermodynamically constrained and therefore valid for all sites. Initial litter input quality and edaphic interactions (both local by definition) and microbial efficiency (possibly affected by nutrient stoichiometry) were instead considered site-specific. Initial litter input quality explained most observed kinetics variability, and the model predicted a convergence toward a common kinetics over time. Site-specific variables played no detectable role. The decay of decades-old SOM seemed mostly influenced by OM chemistry and was well described by first order kinetics and a single set of general kinetics parameters.},

abstract = {Agroforestry is a form of productive land management that combines trees or bushes with annual crops or pasture, and it can bring benefits in terms of food security and increased carbon (C) sequestration compared with conventional agriculture. But agroforestry as a structured form of agronomic management is relatively new compared with well-established and widespread agronomic systems. Consequently, there is a lack of data and few models of soil organic carbon (SOC) have been developed specifically for agroforestry systems. Also, agroforestry SOC sequestration data measured in field experiments are often reported only as average linear sequestration rates over the study period. This approach, equivalent to zero-order kinetics, makes it difficult to compare results since, in reality, SOC sequestration rates are variable over time and change depending on the duration of measurements. Sequestration rates are also strongly dependent on former C stocks in the soil, further hampering comparisons between agroforestry systems established on different former land uses. To describe the SOC stocks variation over time, researchers often employ models considering at least first-order kinetics. This approach can take care of the two above mentioned issues, considering both the variation of the sequestration over time and the effect of previous land use. However, the variability of agroforestry systems makes applying these models more challenging compared to simpler agricultural systems. To deal with this problem we propose to use detailed uncertainty estimation methods, based on stochastic calibrations that can deal with broad probability distributions. To do so, we adapted a first-order compartmental SOC model to agroforestry systems. It was calibrated within a Bayesian framework on global agroforestry data. Compared to linear coefficients, the model (ICBMAgroforestry) estimates equilibrium SOC stocks of different agroforestry systems probabilistically and is providing uncertainty bounds. These values are independent of initial land use and time duration of the experiments. ICBMAgroforestry can be used for rapid assessment and comparison of the maximum potential SOC stocks for different agroforestry systems and climatic zones. In this study, we could use our approach to estimate the global maximum C that can be sequestered by agroforestry systems at equilibrium, which ranged between 156 and 263 Mg C ha−1 on average, above but comparable with similar estimates for simpler agricultural systems.},

While empirical models derive their structure and parameters from representative data sets, process-based model (PBM) parameters should be evaluated in ranges that have a biological meaning independently of output data. At the same time PBMs should be calibrated against observations in order to obtain unbiased estimates and an understanding of their predictive capability. By means of model data assimilation, we Bayesian calibrated a forest model (PREBAS) using an extensive dataset that covered a wide range of climatic conditions, species composition and management practices. PREBAS was calibrated for three species in Finland: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] H. Karst.) and Silver birch (Betula pendula L.). Data assimilation was strongly effective in reducing the uncertainty of PREBAS parameters and predictions. A country-generic calibration showed robust performances in predicting forest variables and the results were consistent with yield tables and national forest statistics. The posterior predictive uncertainty of the model was mainly influenced by the uncertainty of the structural and measurement error.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO(2). Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.},

abstract = {<p>Agroforestry is an increasingly popular farming system enabling agricultural diversification and providing several ecosystem services. In agroforestry systems, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are generally increased, but it is difficult to disentangle the different factors responsible for this storage. Organic carbon (OC) inputs to the soil may be larger, but SOC decomposition rates may be modified owing to microclimate, physical protection, or priming effect from roots, especially at depth. We used an 18-year-old silvoarable system associating hybrid walnut trees (<i>Juglans regia</i>&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;<i>nigra</i>) and durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L. subsp. <i>durum</i>), and an adjacent agricultural control plot to quantify all OC inputs to the soil &ndash; leaf litter, tree fine root senescence, crop residues, and tree row herbaceous vegetation &ndash;, and measure SOC stocks down 2&thinsp;m depth at varying distances from the trees. We then proposed a model that simulates SOC dynamics in agroforestry accounting for both the whole soil profile and the lateral spatial heterogeneity. <br><br> OC inputs to soil were increased by about 40&thinsp;% (&plus;1.11&thinsp;t C&thinsp;ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>&thinsp;yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) down to 2&thinsp;m depth in the agroforestry plot compared to the control, resulting in an additional SOC stock of 6.3&thinsp;t C&thinsp;ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> down to 1&thinsp;m depth. The model described properly the measured SOC stocks and distribution with depth. It showed that the increased inputs of fresh biomass to soil explained the observed additional SOC storage in the agroforestry plot. Moreover, modeling revealed a strong priming effect that would reduce the potential SOC storage due to higher organic inputs in the agroforestry system by 75 to 90&thinsp;%. This result questions the potential of soils to store large amounts of carbon, especially at depth. Deep-rooted trees modify OC inputs to soil, a process that deserves further studies given its potential effects on SOC dynamics.</p>},

This was the most widespread and abrupt LUC in the 20th century in the northern hemisphere. The spontaneous withdrawal of croplands in 1990s caused several benefits for environment including substantial C sequestration in post-agrogenic ecosystems. The new estimations of net ecosystem production (NEP) and changes in soil organic carbon stocks (??SOC) in post-agrogenic ecosystems presented here are based on the uniform bio-climatic approach, and hereby, allow to update C balance of the former USSR. The total extra C sink in abandoned croplands in Russia (45.5 Mha) and Kazakhstan (12.9 Mha) is estimated to be 155??27 Mt C yr-1 and 31??2 Mt C yr-1, respectively. This additional C sink could cover about 18% of the global CO2 release due to deforestation and other land use changes or compensate annually about 36% and 49% of the current fossil fuel emissions in Russia and Kazakhstan, respectively. The extra C sink to the post-agrogenic ecosystems in Russia and Kazakhstan contributes possibly about 1/3 part to the total current C balance of the former USSR. Hence, the disintegration of the former USSR significantly affected national and global C budget over few decades after LUC.},

abstract = {Decomposition of soil carbon stocks is one of the largest potential biotic feedbacks to climate change. Models of decomposition of soil organic matter and of soil respiration rely on empirical functions that relate variation in temperature and soil water content to rates of microbial metabolism using soil-C substrates. Here, we describe a unifying modeling framework to combine the effects of temperature, soil water content, and soluble substrate supply on decomposition of soluble soil-C substrates using simple functions based on process concepts. The model's backbone is the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the relationship between reaction velocity and soluble organic-C and O2 substrate concentrations at an enzyme's reactive site, which are determined by diffusivity functions based on soil water content. Temperature sensitivity is simulated by allowing the maximum velocity of the reaction (Vmax) to vary according to Arrhenius function. The Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis–Menten kinetics (DAMM) model core was able to predict effectively observations from of laboratory enzyme assays of $\beta$-glucosidase and phenol-oxidase across a range of substrate concentrations and incubation temperatures. The model also functioned as well or better than purely empirical models for simulating hourly and seasonal soil respiration data from a trenched plot in a deciduous forest at the Harvard Forest, in northeastern United States. The DAMM model demonstrates that enzymatic processes can be intrinsically temperature sensitive, but environmental constrains of substrate supply under soil moisture extremes can prevent that response to temperature from being observed. We discuss how DAMM could serve as a core module that is informed by other modules regarding microbial dynamics and supply of soluble-C substrates from plant inputs and from desorption of physically stabilized soil-C pools. Most importantly, it presents a way forward from purely empirical representation of temperature and moisture responses and integrates temperature-sensitive enzymatic processes with constraints of substrate supply.},

Phosphorus (P) is suggested to be a limited nutrient in many Amazonian ecosystems because soils are ancient, highly weathered, and nutrient depleted. Recently, it has been suggested that large herbivores may play a major role in the Amazon nutrient cycle. Here, we develop this hypothesis further and show how the spatial redistribution of P from rivers to land, across different ecosystems and between sub-basins may even sustain the Amazonian P cycle, and this not only by means of large herbivores, which supposedly were present previously to human arrival to the contient, but by different animal foraging strategies that exist today. To do so, we introduce a simple mathematical framework, which synthesizes the major processes of the Amazonian P cycle and allows for quantifying their relative contribution to the P budget. With this model we use sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how animals can affect the P cycle. Our findings suggest the importance of the interweaved Amazonian ecology, including fish migrations, different flooding and soil moisture regimes as well as the role of different animal foraging strategies for a sustainable P cycling in these ecosystems.</p>},

abstract = {The contribution of agroforestry systems (AFS) to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in soil layers due to the presence of deep tree roots are of interest in the context of promoting carbon sinks and greenhouse gas mitigation. To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees in agroforestry systems (AFS), this study assessed the reported differences in SOC stocks under agroforestry systems in comparison with other land-use systems (Agriculture, Forestry, Pasture, or Uncultivated Land) in various soil-depth classes in four agroecological regions (arid and semiarid, ASA; lowland humid tropics, LHT; Mediterranean, MED; and temperate, TEM) around the world. Using mixed-effect models and a meta-analytical approach, we synthesized data from 78 peer-reviewed studies that generated 858 data points (sites) on SOC stock under various AFS practiced globally. Comparing Agroforest vs. Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher by +27% in the ASA region, +26% in LHT, and +5.8% in TEM, but –5.3% in the TEM in the 0–100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged between 10–20 years had higher SOC stock than newly established, as well as <10-year-old systems across all soil-depth classes and agroecological regions. Overall, Agroforest vs. Agriculture land management practices resulted in positive SOC stock changes within AFS up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest – Agroforest – Agriculture – Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid and semiarid region, closely followed by the low humid tropics. The important outcome of this meta-analysis is worthy of emphasizing of the role of AFS in climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies by promoting carbon sinks.},

abstract = {Historical observations indicate a shift toward shorter winters and increased average air temperatures in the midwestern United States. Furthermore, a rise in soil temperatures is likely to be enhanced under projections of increased air temperature; however, reduced snow cover during winter may lead to colder soil temperatures in the future. Cumulatively, these changes will affect cold season processes in the region. Therefore the impact of such changes on cold season processes were analyzed under two climate models (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory version CM2.1.1 (GFDL) and UK Met Office Hadley Center Climate Model, version 3.1 (HadCM3)) and three scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2) by implementing the variable infiltration capacity land surface model from 1977 to 2099. Ensemble averages of the two models for the three scenarios indicated that both air temperature and precipitation would increase in the cold season (December–May), with the greatest increases projected under the A2 scenario by late in the 21st century (2070–2099). Also during this period, the median number of days when air temperature was below 0°C reduced in comparison to the base period (1977–2006) by 25, 35, and 38 days for the B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios, respectively. The number of freeze‐thaw cycles increased in the south‐central Wisconsin and the northern regions of Michigan by up to 3 cycles, while the duration of soil frost decreased by between 2 weeks and nearly 2 months during 2070–2099 with respect to the base period.},

@article{Erhagen2013,
abstract = {The global soil carbon pool is approximately three times larger than the contemporary atmospheric pool, therefore even minor changes to its integrity may have major implications for atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While theory predicts that the chemical composition of organic matter should constitute a master control on the temperature response of its decomposition, this relationship has not yet been fully demonstrated. We used laboratory incubations of forest soil organic matter (SOM) and fresh litter material together with NMR spectroscopy to make this connection between organic chemical composition and temperature sensitivity of decomposition. Temperature response of decomposition in both fresh litter and SOM was directly related to the chemical composition of the constituent organic matter, explaining 90% and 70% of the variance in Q10 in litter and SOM, respectively. The Q10 of litter decreased with increasing proportions of aromatic and O-aromatic compounds, and increased with increased contents of alkyl- and O-alkyl carbons. In contrast, in SOM, decomposition was affected only by carbonyl compounds. To reveal why a certain group of organic chemical compounds affected the temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition in litter and SOM, a more detailed characterization of the (13) C aromatic region using Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) was conducted. The results revealed considerable differences in the aromatic region between litter and SOM. This suggests that the correlation between chemical composition of organic matter and the temperature response of decomposition differed between litter and SOM. The temperature response of soil decomposition processes can thus be described by the chemical composition of its constituent organic matter, this paves the way for improved ecosystem modeling of biosphere feedbacks under a changing climate.},

@article{Kramer2003,
abstract = {Most soil organic matter (SOM) derives from plant material, but there are substantial gaps in our understanding of its transformation mechanisms. Alterations that occur as SOM decays and is stabilized have proved difficult to study owing largely to its diverse initial chemical composition and stable isotope values. We examined SOM stable isotope ratios in relation to composition using solid-state 13 C Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spin (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in sequentially deeper organic and mineral horizon soil samples collected from an unpolluted ecosystem in southeast Alaska, USA, dominated by C3 vegetation.We found that, as humified carbon (C not respired as CO2 during decomposition) increased in aliphaticity (ratio of unsubstituted aliphatics to carbohydrates), it also increased in 15 N but showed no clear trend in 13 C. These results imply that humification (and the concomitant stabilization of soil C) at our site resulted from microbial alteration of organics rather than from accumulation of recalcitrant com- pounds. The strong, and previously unreported, relation between 15 N and SOM composition found at our study site suggests that degree of SOM humification may be correlated with an increase in ?15 N SOM values relative to ?15 N for fresh litter and other source material.},

@article{Menichetti2014a,
abstract = {Changes in the (12)C/(13)C ratio (expressed as $\delta$(13)C) of soil organic C (SOC) has been observed over long time scales and with depth in soil profiles. The changes are ascribed to the different reaction kinetics of (12)C and (13)C isotopes and the different isotopic composition of various SOC pool components. However, experimental verification of the subtle isotopic shifts associated with SOC turnover under field conditions is scarce. We determined $\delta$(13)C and SOC in soil sampled during 1929-2009 in the Ap-horizon of five European long-term bare fallow experiments kept without C inputs for 27-80 years and covering a latitudinal range of 11°. The bare fallow soils lost 33-65 % of their initial SOC content and showed a mean annual $\delta$(13)C increase of 0.008-0.024 ‰. The (13)C enrichment could be related empirically to SOC losses by a Rayleigh distillation equation. A more complex mechanistic relationship was also examined. The overall estimate of the fractionation coefficient ($\epsilon$) was -1.2 ± 0.3 ‰. This coefficient represents an important input to studies of long-term SOC dynamics in agricultural soils that are based on variations in (13)C natural abundance. The variance of $\epsilon$ may be ascribed to site characteristics not disclosed in our study, but the very similar kinetics measured across our five experimental sites suggest that overall site-specific factors (including climate) had a marginal influence and that it may be possible to isolate a general mechanism causing the enrichment, although pre-fallow land use may have some impact on isotope abundance and fractionation.},

@article{Cai2017,
abstract = {<p>There is a significant potential to increase yield of maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), a global major crop, in rain-fed condition in semi-arid regions, since the large yield gap is mainly caused by frequent droughts halfway the crop growing period due to uneven distribution of rainfall. It is questionable if irrigation systems are economically required in such a region since total amount of rainfall generally meet the crop requirement. This study therefore aimed to quantitatively determine the effects of water stress during jointing to filling stages on root and shoot growth and the consequences for maize grain yield, above- and below-ground dry matter, water uptake (WU) and water use efficiency (WUE). Pot experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 with a mobile rain shelter. The experiments consisted of three treatments: (1) no water stress; (2) mild water stress; and (3) severe water stress. Maize yield in mild water stress across two year was not significantly affected, while severe stress reduced yield by 56&thinsp;%. Water stress decreased root biomass slightly but shoot biomass substantially. Mild water stress decreased root length but increased root diameter, resulting a no effect on root surface area. WU under water stress was decreased, while WUE for maize above-ground dry matter under mild water stress was increased by 20&thinsp;% across all years, and 16&thinsp;% for grain yield WUE. Our results demonstrates that irrigation systems in studied region might be not economically necessary because the mild water stress does not reduce crop yield. The study helps to understand crop responses to water stress during critical water-sensitive period and to mitigate drought risk in dry land agriculture.</p>},

abstract = {A range of continental-scale soil datasets exists in Europe with different spatial representation and based on different principles. We developed comprehensive pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for applications principally on spatial datasets with continental coverage. The PTF development included the prediction of soil water retention at various matric potentials and prediction of parameters to characterize soil moisture retention and the hydraulic conductivity curve (MRC and HCC) of European soils. We developed PTFs with a hierarchical approach, determined by the input requirements. The PTFs were derived by using three statistical methods: (i) linear regression where there were quantitative input variables, (ii) a regression tree for qualitative, quantitative and mixed types of information and (iii) mean statistics of developer-defined soil groups (class PTF) when only qualitative input parameters were available. Data of the recently established European Hydropedological Data Inventory (EU-HYDI), which holds the most comprehensive geographical and thematic coverage of hydro-pedological data in Europe, were used to train and test the PTFs. The applied modelling techniques and the EU-HYDI allowed the development of hydraulic PTFs that are more reliable and applicable for a greater variety of input parameters than those previously available for Europe. Therefore the new set of PTFs offers tailored advanced tools for a wide range of applications in the continent.},

A key prerequisite for the investigation was the development of a simple device to isolate the microaggregates (53-250??m) contained within stable (i.e., resistant to slaking) macroaggregates (>250??m) obtained by conventional wet-sieving. By comparing the abundance and C content of micro-within-macroaggregates, the size distribution of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and isotopically-based estimates of the age of the organic matter in the different fractions, we were able to corroborate our hypothesis that the absence of tillage (i.e., in no-till and native soils) promotes greater longevity of newly-formed macroaggregates, resulting in greater SOM stabilization in microaggregates formed within stable macroaggregates. Follow-up research has indicated that the microaggregate-within-macroaggregate fraction is 1) potentially a robust indicator for management-induced SOC changes over decadal time scales, 2) of biological origin and therefore useful in interpreting impacts of soil biota on soil C and N dynamics, but not in-situ CO2 and N2O fluxes, 3) useful in complimentary chemical and spectroscopic approaches to relate SOM dynamics to soil structure and attributes of the soil pore space, and 4) a good candidate for being incorporated into models as a measurable fraction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The paper assesses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of forest bioenergy supply and utilization in Finland. Each step in the supply chains of harvesting residues (HR), small-diameter energy wood (EW) and stumps (ST) is assessed separately, with geography-related differences between Northern and Southern Finland (NF and SF) taken into consideration. Furthermore, the GHG performance of five distinct bioenergy options - (1) combined heat and power production, (2) condensing power production, (3) torrefied pellets, (4) gasification, and (5) pyrolysis oil production - is assessed and compared with that of current reference systems in Finland and also the European Union (EU) sustainability criteria. If soil carbon stock (SCS) changes and possible storage emissions are omitted, the GHG emissions deriving from the supply chain of comminuted forest biomass to plants are 2.4, 3.0, and 2.6 gCO2eq MJ-1 for HR, EW, and ST in SF, respectively. In NF, the corresponding values are 2.9, 3.6, and 3.2 gCO2eq MJ-1, respectively. If SCS changes and possible emissions from storage are accounted for, the emissions for HR, EW, and ST are in the ranges 9.2-49.2, 24.4-64.4, and 33.1-73.1 gCO2eq MJ-1 in SF and 12.7-52.7, 29.4-69.4, and 39.5-79.5 gCO2eq MJ-1 in NF. Most supply-chain GHG emissions arise from SCS changes and possible emissions from storage of comminuted biomass, both of which may involve significant uncertainty factors. In comparison to local reference systems, significant GHG savings can be achieved through energy utilization of forest biomass, but if SCS changes and, in particular, storage emissions are taken into account, fulfillment of the EU sustainability criteria is not guaranteed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Management of the world's forests can play a role for climate change mitigation by increasing CO2 storage in vegetation biomass and harvested wood products, and by displacing CO2-intensive materials such as steel or concrete. This study aimed to determine how management of boreal forest stands could contribute to climate change mitigation in the context of ecosystem-based management. The study was based on the comparison of different strategies applied to a balsam fir-white birch stand in the Eastern boreal forest of Quebec (Canada). Five scenarios were simulated over a 199-year period at the stand level: A reference scenario involving clearcut at 50-year intervals, and four alternative scenarios clearcut with longer rotation length (70 and 80 years), partial cut, and a no harvest scenario. The study included an appropriate sensitivity analysis of the results. Overall, scenarios with longer clearcut rotations and, to a lesser extent, partial cut resulted in a higher potential to mitigate climate change. The substitution effect of wood products was revealed as a key aspect, suggesting that wood product manufacturing and utilization on the markets, and not only forest management, need to be carefully considered.},

abstract = {Global warming is predicted to be most pronounced at high latitudes, and observational evidence over the past 25 years suggests that this warming is already under way. One-third of the global soil carbon pool is stored in northern latitudes, so there is considerable interest in understanding how the carbon balance of northern ecosystems will respond to climate warming. Observations of controls over plant productivity in tundra and boreal ecosystems have been used to build a conceptual model of response to warming, where warmer soils and increased decomposition of plant litter increase nutrient availability, which, in turn, stimulates plant production and increases ecosystem carbon storage. Here we present the results of a long-term fertilization experiment in Alaskan tundra, in which increased nutrient availability caused a net ecosystem loss of almost 2,000 grams of carbon per square meter over 20 years. We found that annual aboveground plant production doubled during the experiment. Losses of carbon and nitrogen from deep soil layers, however, were substantial and more than offset the increased carbon and nitrogen storage in plant biomass and litter. Our study suggests that projected release of soil nutrients associated with high-latitude warming may further amplify carbon release from soils, causing a net loss of ecosystem carbon and a positive feedback to climate warming.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) models currently in widespread use omit known microbial processes, and assume the existence of a SOC pool whose intrinsic properties confer persistence for centuries to millennia, despite evidence from priming and aggregate turnover that cast doubt on the existence of SOC with profound intrinsic stability. Here we show that by including microbial interactions in a SOC model, persistence can be explained as a feedback between substrate availability, mineral protection and microbial population size, without invoking an unproven pool that is intrinsically stable for centuries. The microbial SOC model based on this concept reproduces long-term data (r 2 = 0.92; n = 90), global SOC distribution (rmse = 4.7 +/− 0.6 kg C m −2 ), and total global SOC in the top 0.3 m (822 Pg C) accurately. SOC dynamics based on a microbial feedback without stable pools are thus consistent with global SOC distribution. This has important implications for carbon management, suggesting that relatively fast cycling, rather than recalcitrant, SOC must form the primary target of efforts to build SOC stocks.},

Ecotopes had a significant impact on CO2 and CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere. Ecosystem respiration and CH4 emissions from the bare peat site, the constructed shallow lake and the open poor fen were low but were much higher from ecotopes with Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and Eriophorum angustifolium. A combination of vascular plant cover and high soil temperatures enhanced ecosystem respiration, while a combination of vascular plant cover, high water table levels and high soil temperatures enhanced CH4 emissions. N2O emissions contributed little to total greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere. However, the overall climate impact of CH4 emissions from the study area did not exceed the impact of soil and plant respiration. With regard to management of extracted peatlands, the construction of a nutrient-poor shallow lake showed great potential for lowering GHG fluxes to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {We studied the responses of soil microbial biomass, respiration and enzyme activities to temperature in three Mexican soils. Soils were incubated at temperature range of 15–550 °C at 50 (wet) and 10 % (dry) of their water holding capacity. Soils were assayed for their adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, CO2-C evolution and acid and alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, $\beta$-glucosidase, urease, and protease activities. Thermal responses of soil enzyme activities were fitted to both the equilibrium model (EM) and the classical Q10 model to describe the effects of temperature on enzyme activity. Total organic C, Fe speciation, available P, and inorganic N contents were also determined in all soils and at all temperatures. The results showed that the ATP content, CO2-C evolution, and enzyme activities of soil increased within the temperature range 15–65 °C, and at higher temperatures, soil enzyme activities were more resistant than the ATP content and CO2-C evolution. The effects of temperature were more drastic in wet than in dry soil, although the two soil series displayed similar trends. The enzyme activities showed a good fit to the EM, making this model suitable for determining activation energy, enthalpy of inactivation, and equilibrium inactivation temperatures of soil enzymatic reactions. The results of the EM indicated that soil chemical parameters may not affect the activation energy of enzyme reactions, but may influence the enzyme resistance to inactivation at higher temperature. The results also indicated that the EM model can be used for predicting the impact of high temperatures on soil enzyme activities.},

abstract = {Agroforestry is an increasingly popular farming system enabling agricultural diversification and providing several ecosystem services. In agroforestry systems, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are generally increased, but it is difficult to disentangle the different factors responsible for this storage. Organic carbon (OC) inputs to the soil may be larger, but SOC decomposition rates may be modified owing to microclimate, physical protection, or priming effect from roots, especially at depth. We used an 18-year-old silvoarable system associating hybrid walnut trees (<i>Juglans regia</i>&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;<i>nigra</i>) and durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L. subsp. <i>durum</i>), and an adjacent agricultural control plot to quantify all OC inputs to the soil &ndash; leaf litter, tree fine root senescence, crop residues, and tree row herbaceous vegetation &ndash;, and measure SOC stocks down 2&thinsp;m depth at varying distances from the trees. We then proposed a model that simulates SOC dynamics in agroforestry accounting for both the whole soil profile and the lateral spatial heterogeneity. <br><br> OC inputs to soil were increased by about 40&thinsp;% (&plus;1.11&thinsp;t C&thinsp;ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>&thinsp;yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) down to 2&thinsp;m depth in the agroforestry plot compared to the control, resulting in an additional SOC stock of 6.3&thinsp;t C&thinsp;ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> down to 1&thinsp;m depth. The model described properly the measured SOC stocks and distribution with depth. It showed that the increased inputs of fresh biomass to soil explained the observed additional SOC storage in the agroforestry plot. Moreover, modeling revealed a strong priming effect that would reduce the potential SOC storage due to higher organic inputs in the agroforestry system by 75 to 90&thinsp;%. This result questions the potential of soils to store large amounts of carbon, especially at depth. Deep-rooted trees modify OC inputs to soil, a process that deserves further studies given its potential effects on SOC dynamics.},

abstract = {Glyphosate (GLY) is a broad-spectrum herbicide used for weed control. The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foraging-related behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance.},

abstract = {The decomposition of woody litter is a biochemical process, controlled by physical, chemical and biological environmental conditions. To develop a practicable model of this complex process, it is necessary to identify the major controlling factors and quantify their effects. We used four data sets (total N= 2102) on mass loss of decomposing woody litter in Northern Europe to extend an earlier decomposition model of non-woody litter and make it suitable for describing also decomposition of woody litter. We compared alternative ways to model the effects of size and chemical composition of woody litter on decomposition using the Bayesian model selection theory. The best model fitted to the diverse data sets (woody litter of four tree species, diameter 0.5-60 cm, time series up to 70 years) with little systematic error. Based on this result, we concluded that the extended model is suitable for describing decomposition of woody litter of the common tree species in the boreal forests studied. According to the model developed, frequently observed sigmoidal patterns in mass loss of woody litter are related to high concentrations of slowly decomposing lignin compounds and these patterns become stronger with an increasing size of decomposing woody litter. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In northern temperate environments, assessments of ungulate winter range in forested ecosystems commonly focus on measuring availability of browse because the dietary proportion of browse is typically high in winter. In many cases, these efforts ignore reductions in browse availability due to snow burial because this effect is difficult to measure. In this paper, we show how consideration of snow burial can alter the relative availability of browse in 6 forest communities common in the east slopes of the Rocky Mountains of the Alberta, Canada. We developed species-specific allometric relationships of stem diameter and woody twig biomass and height for the common shrub species and used these models to predict the decline in the proportion of total biomass/stem available to ungulates relative to stem height. Based on measures of stem densities, we then compared declines in browse availability for all browse species and for preferred browse species with increasing snow depths. Species compositional differences between forest types influenced the decline in browse availability as snow depth increased.

abstract = {Basic human values were investigated in Swiss farmers. The main objective was to take a first step toward elucidating the structure and profile of basic human values in farmers. Data from the first three rounds (2002, 2004, 2006) of the European Social Survey were used. Value orientations were assessed with Shalom H. Schwartz's 21-item Portrait Values Questionnaire (2003b). The value orientations of the farmers (n = 125) were compared with those of the general Swiss population (n = 5,055) in terms of structure. In addition, the farmers' scores in four higher-order value types were compared with those of the general population, managers of small enterprises (n = 103), and production and operations managers (n = 155). The structure of Schwartz's four higher-order value types were replicated in the Swiss population as well as in the farmer sample. The farmers showed the highest score in conservation, followed by self-transcendence, self-enhancement, and lastly, openness to change. Their value profile differed from that of the general population and that of both groups of managers. According to the farmers' value profile, recent agricultural policy strategies to promote farmers' ecological behavior may not be structured and marketed in a manner which is in line with their basic values.},

abstract = {Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Py-GC/IRMS) were used to determine the individual turnover rate of specific carbohydrates, lignin, lipids and N-containing compounds from French arable soils. The analysed soils were cultivated, either continuously with a C3 plant (wheat delta(13)C-value = -25.2 per thousand), or transferred to a C4 plant (maize delta(13)C-value = -11.4 per thousand) cropping 23 years ago. Most pyrolysis products identified were related to carbohydrates (furans), lipids (hydrocarbons and derivatives of benzene), proteins (nitriles and pyrrole) and lignins (phenols). The relative yield of all individual pyrolysis products was similar in the samples from the maize and control wheat soil. The isotopic enrichment between identical pyrolysis products from the two soils varied from 1 to 12 delta (delta) units, indicating that after 23 years of cultivation 7 to 90% of their C was derived from maize. This suggests a slow mean turnover time varying from 9 to 220 years. Based on the differences in isotopic enrichment of chemical structures after vegetation change the pyrolysis products could be divided into three groups: (i) pyrolysis products with a nearly complete C4 signal, e. g. phenol, derived from lignin degradation products, (ii) pyrolysis products with an intermediate isotopic enrichment of 6-8 per thousand, most likely to be a composite of remaining (possibly physically protected) fragments derived from both maize and native wheat, and (iii) pyrolysis products showing only low enrichments in (13)C of 1-3 per thousand. Most of their precursors were found to be proteinaceaous materials. This indicates that proteins or peptides are indeed preserved during decomposition and humification processes occurring in the soil. Our study highlights the potential of Py-GC/MS-C-IRMS to further novel insights into the dynamics of soil organic constituents. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The specific growth rate constant for bacterial growth does not obey the Arrhenius-type kinetics displayed by simple chemical reactions. Instead, for bacteria, steep convex curves are observed on an Arrhenius plot at the low- and high-temperature ends of the biokinetic range, with a region towards the middle of the growth range loosely approximating linearity. This central region has been considered by microbiologists to be the "normal physiological range" for bacterial growth, a concept whose meaningfulness we now question. We employ a kinetic model incorporating thermodynamic terms for temperature-induced enzyme denaturation, central to which is a term to account for the large positive heat capacity change during unfolding of the proteins within the bacteria. It is now widely believed by biophysicists that denaturation of complex proteins and/or other macromolecules is due to hydrophobic hydration of non-polar compounds. Denaturation is seen as the process by which enthalpic and entropic forces becomes imbalanced both at high and at low temperatures resulting in conformational changes in the enzyme structure that expose hydrophobic amino acid groups to the surrounding water molecules. The "thermodynamic" rate model, incorporating the heat capacity change and its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the system, fitted 35 sets of data for psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria well, resulting in biologically meaningful estimates for the important thermodynamic parameters. As these results mirror those obtained by biophysicists for globular proteins, it appears that the same or a similar mechanism applies to bacteria as applies to proteins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this chapter, a variety of environmental and chemical factors affecting the biodegradability or rate of decomposition of organic compounds and natural materials are considered. Resistance of an organic compound to microbial degradation may be attributable to one of the several ecological determinants or to the structure of the chemical itself. Till date, little systematic work has been directed toward establishment of the physiological, physical, and chemical bases for the persistence of specific compounds or complex natural materials in individual environments and the resistance of certain substances to biodegradation. Compiling data, though time-consuming, is not too difficult; providing explanations for these observations is, at the present time, almost impossible. Among the factors that probably affect the biodegradability or decomposition rate of organic materials are: Inaccessibility of the substrate; Absence of some factor essential for growth; Toxicity of the environment; Inactivation of the requisite enzymes; A structural characteristics of the molecule which prevents the enzyme from acting; and the inability of the community of microorganisms to metabolize the compound because of some physiological inadequacy. However, some comments and suggestions can be advanced, but these clearly must be, in the absence of sufficient experimentation, frequently naive or, at best, inadequate.},

abstract = {<p>Soils play a pivotal role in major global biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nutrient and water), while hosting the largest diversity of organisms on land. Because of this, soils deliver fundamental ecosystem services, and management to change a soil process in support of one ecosystem service can either provide co-benefits to other services or can result in trade-offs. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding concerning the biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity in soil, and relate these to the provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services which they underpin. We then outline key knowledge gaps and research challenges, before providing recommendations for management activities to support the continued delivery of ecosystem services from soils. <br><br> We conclude that although there are knowledge gaps that require further research, enough is known to start improving soils globally. The main challenge is in finding ways to share knowledge with soil managers and policy-makers, so that best-practice management can be implemented. A key element of this knowledge sharing must be in raising awareness of the multiple ecosystem services underpinned by soils, and the natural capital they provide. The International Year of Soils in 2015 presents the perfect opportunity to begin a step-change in how we harness scientific knowledge to bring about more sustainable use of soils for a secure global society.</p>},

abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the landscape sustainability in terms of landscape services (LS) provided in seven study areas with different characteristics located in Malopolska Province. The results of the qualitative categorization of LS using an assessment matrix were juxtaposed with the results of the quantitative assessment using indicators. As a result, study areas were divided into three groups regarding the bundle of provided LS. In multifunctional landscapes characterized by moderate flow of most LS and often high flow of cultural LS, there were: high landscape diversity, moderate connectivity of forest patches and moderate values of regulating LS. Mountainous landscape with a high flow of regulating LS was characterized by moderate landscape diversity, high connectivity of forest class and high values of erosion control and climate regulation. In agricultural landscapes with a high flow of agricultural production LS, there were: low landscape diversity and connectivity of forest patches, low values of erosion control and climate regulation, but high values of nutrient retention. Consequently, all analyzed landscapes may be described as sustainable in terms of LS, as every landscape provides a specific bundle of LS and a reasonable level of landscape diversity, connectivity and regulating LS. The qualitative categorization of LS provided the most complete perspective on LS provided in the study areas. Landscape metrics (LM) allow the significance of landscape diversity and connectivity to be emphasized, whereas the quantitative analysis of regulating LS allow to compare the results of quantitative assessment and qualitative categorization. These two types of indicators are especially useful when threshold values are required. Composition metrics (proportion of forest and arable land) allow a determination of landscapes dominated by regulating and provisioning LS, whereas configuration metrics (especially Shannon's Diversity Index and Contagion Index) allow landscapes with a high flow of cultural LS to be identified.},

abstract = {Although uncertainty about structures of environmental models (conceptual uncertainty) is often acknowledged to be the main source of uncertainty in model predictions, it is rarely considered in environmental modelling. Rather, formal uncertainty analyses have traditionally focused on model parameters and input data as the principal source of uncertainty in model predictions. The traditional approach to model uncertainty analysis, which considers only a single conceptual model, may fail to adequately sample the relevant space of plausible conceptual models. As such, it is prone to modelling bias and underestimation of predictive uncertainty. In this paper we review a range of strategies for assessing structural uncertainties in models. The existing strategies fall into two categories depending on whether field data are available for the predicted variable of interest. To date, most research has focussed on situations where inferences on the accuracy of a model structure can be made directly on the basis of field data. This corresponds to a situation of 'interpolation'. However, in many cases environmental models are used for 'extrapolation'; that is, beyond the situation and the field data available for calibration. In the present paper, a framework is presented for assessing the predictive uncertainties of environmental models used for extrapolation. It involves the use of multiple conceptual models, assessment of their pedigree and reflection on the extent to which the sampled models adequately represent the space of plausible models. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Waring2020,
abstract = {Soils represent the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon, and the balance between soil organic carbon (SOC) formation and loss will drive powerful carbon-climate feedbacks over the coming century. To date, efforts to predict SOC dynamics have rested on pool-based models, which assume classes of SOC with internally homogenous physicochemical properties. However, emerging evidence suggests that soil carbon turnover is not dominantly controlled by the chemistry of carbon inputs, but rather by restrictions on microbial access to organic matter in the spatially heterogeneous soil environment. The dynamic processes that control the physicochemical protection of carbon translate poorly to pool-based SOC models; as a result, we are challenged to mechanistically predict how environmental change will impact movement of carbon between soils and the atmosphere. Here, we propose a novel conceptual framework to explore controls on belowground carbon cycling: Probabilistic Representation of Organic Matter Interactions within the Soil Environment (PROMISE). In contrast to traditional model frameworks, PROMISE does not attempt to define carbon pools united by common thermodynamic or functional attributes. Rather, the PROMISE concept considers how SOC cycling rates are governed by the stochastic processes that influence the proximity between microbial decomposers and organic matter, with emphasis on their physical location in the soil matrix. We illustrate the applications of this framework with a new biogeochemical simulation model that traces the fate of individual carbon atoms as they interact with their environment, undergoing biochemical transformations and moving through the soil pore space. We also discuss how the PROMISE framework reshapes dialogue around issues related to SOC management in a changing world. We intend the PROMISE framework to spur the development of new hypotheses, analytical tools, and model structures across disciplines that will illuminate mechanistic controls on the flow of carbon between plant, soil, and atmospheric pools.},

abstract = {<p>Soil organic matter (SOM) is key to maintaining soil fertility, mitigating climate change, combatting land degradation, and conserving above- and below-ground biodiversity and associated soil processes and ecosystem services. In order to derive management options for maintaining these essential services provided by soils, policy makers depend on robust, predictive models identifying key drivers of SOM dynamics. Existing SOM models and suggested guidelines for future SOM modelling are defined mostly in terms of plant residue quality and input and microbial decomposition, overlooking the significant regulation provided by soil fauna. The fauna controls almost any aspect of organic matter turnover, foremost by regulating the activity and functional composition of soil microorganisms and their physical&ndash;chemical connectivity with soil organic matter. We demonstrate a very strong impact of soil animals on carbon turnover, increasing or decreasing it by several dozen percent, sometimes even turning C sinks into C sources or vice versa. This is demonstrated not only for earthworms and other larger invertebrates but also for smaller fauna such as Collembola. We suggest that inclusion of soil animal activities (plant residue consumption and bioturbation altering the formation, depth, hydraulic properties and physical heterogeneity of soils) can fundamentally affect the predictive outcome of SOM models. Understanding direct and indirect impacts of soil fauna on nutrient availability, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions and plant growth is key to the understanding of SOM dynamics in the context of global carbon cycling models. We argue that explicit consideration of soil fauna is essential to make realistic modelling predictions on SOM dynamics and to detect expected non-linear responses of SOM dynamics to global change. We present a decision framework, to be further developed through the activities of KEYSOM, a European COST Action, for when mechanistic SOM models include soil fauna. The research activities of KEYSOM, such as field experiments and literature reviews, together with dialogue between empiricists and modellers, will inform how this is to be done.</p>},

abstract = {Nutrient redistribution, deer response to areas containing dung, and plant and soil nutrient content on grazing lawns and adjacent control areas were studied on intensively grazed grasslands in humid lowland Nepal. Effects of experimental fertilisation of grasslands with different amounts of dung pellets were also studied. A high-density population of axis deer recirculated 13 tons (dry mass, DM) of dung per month in the 10 km(2) stop study area. Because of preferential use of the grasslands for feeding while resting elsewhere, 10 tons were lost from the grassland to other habitat types per month during the dry season (February-May). The N, P, K, Na, and Mg content of grass from grazing lawns was significantly higher, probably because the grass was kept in a younger phenological stage of growth. In contrast with results from many other studies, the nutrient content of lawn soil was similar to that of adjacent, less intensively grazed areas, apart from P, which was lower in lawn soils. High plant P requirement on grazing lawns and removal of nutrients by deer may explain low soil P levels. Experiments with pellet fertilisation showed that high dung deposition increased plant P content, probably because of increased P uptake during early stages of growth. Dung deposition did not affect deer grazing preferences.},

The aim of this study was to examine how students describe and perceive their studying and academic emotions during the first semester of higher education in order to analyse the interplay of different factors affecting student learning. The students participated in a compulsory study skills course, and wrote about their study experiences in reflective journals (N = 190) that were analysed qualitatively. Reflective journals have been rarely used in previous research on first year studies. The journals allow students to write about their experiences as a whole, and provide a broad and in-depth picture of students' perceptions of their study habits and learning in higher education. Our results revealed that students' academic emotions were profoundly affected by their self-regulated learning skills. Moreover, the study showed how self-regulated learning and academic emotions were tightly intertwined. In order to enhance student learning both self-regulated learning and academic emotions need to be considered in university teaching, and when universities plan the first year for new students.},

We investigated how Molinia caerulea altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes and DOC concentration as well as their sensitivity to water table level, air and soil temperature in Sphagnum-dominated peat mesocosms. The presence of Molinia caerulea significantly increased CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to Sphagnum and decreased the DOC concentration. The rise in temperature exponentially increased DOC as well as CO2 and CH4 emissions. Molinia caerulea decreased the temperature sensitivity of CO2 emissions, suggesting the presence of a more labile substrate (root exudates), while it increased the temperature sensitivity of CH4 emissions, suggesting a possible change in methanogenic communities.

abstract = {Purpose: In an effort to reduce the environmental impacts of the furniture sector, this study aimed to diagnose the environmental performance of an office cabinet throughout its life cycle. Methods: An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was used, based on the ISO 14044 Standard and ILCD Handbook. The scope of the study considered the entire supply chain, from cradle to grave, including the steps of pre-manufacturing, manufacturing, use, and post-use of the product. The impact assessment method was the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) 2011 midpoint. Results and discussion: The results identified that the most significant environmental impact of the furniture life cycle was due to the distances covered and production of the main raw material, wood medium-density particleboard (MDP). The evaluation of transport scenarios showed environmental tradeoffs for truck fuel switches and environmental gains for the distribution of MDP from closer suppliers by truck, as well as from current supplier by truck and ship in the major categories. Furthermore, evaluation of the office cabinet post-use options showed that reuse, recycling, or energy recovery from waste cause significant environmental gains in the major categories. Wooden furniture is a potential carbon sink if its life cycle does not emit more greenhouse gases than its materials can store. The impacts of substitution scenarios varied depending on the type of product avoided. Conclusions: The LCA proved a powerful method to diagnose and manage environmental impacts in complex product systems. The sensitivity analysis showed that it is possible to reduce the environmental impacts and, at the same time, make the furniture industry increase its economic gains and net carbon stock in the anthroposphere.},

abstract = {Experimental data show that the effect of temperature on enzymes cannot be adequately explained in terms of a two-state model based on increases in activity and denaturation. The Equilibrium Model provides a quantitative explanation of enzyme thermal behaviour under reaction conditions by introducing an inactive (but not denatured) intermediate in rapid equilibrium with the active form. The temperature midpoint (Teq) of the rapid equilibration between the two forms is related to the growth temperature of the organism, and the enthalpy of the equilibrium (DeltaHeq) to its ability to function over various temperature ranges. In the present study, we show that the difference between the active and inactive forms is at the enzyme active site. The results reveal an apparently universal mechanism, independent of enzyme reaction or structure, based at or near the active site, by which enzymes lose activity as temperature rises, as opposed to denaturation which is global. Results show that activity losses below Teq may lead to significant errors in the determination of DeltaG*cat made on the basis of the two-state ('Classical') model, and the measured kcat will then not be a true indication of an enzyme's catalytic power. Overall, the results provide a molecular rationale for observations that the active site tends to be more flexible than the enzyme as a whole, and that activity losses precede denaturation, and provide a general explanation in molecular terms for the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40° to 70°N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6–15.7 g C m−2 year−1for the mean and 3.3–6.3 g C m−2year−1for the median. The overall annual average (mean ± SD) is 12 ± 21 g C m−2year−1with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p <.05) reduces CH4emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.},

abstract = {Understanding the development of northern peatlands and their carbon accumulation dynamics is crucial in order to confidently integrate northern peatlands into global carbon cycle models. To achieve this, northern peatland models are becoming increasingly complex and now include feedback processes between peat depth, decomposition, hydrology, and vegetation composition and productivity. Here we present results from a global sensitivity analysis performed to assess the behavior and parameter interaction of a peatland simulation model. A series of simulations of the Holocene Peat Model were performed with different parameter combinations in order to assess the role of parameter interactions on the simulated total carbon mass after 5000 years of peatland development. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the simulation results is highlighted, as is the importance of multiple parameter interactions. The model sensitivity indicates that peat physical properties play an important role in peat accumulation; these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and should be a focus of future research. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic processes are able to produce a wide range of peatland development behaviors independently of any external environmental changes.},

A meta-analysis was carried out to investigate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 0–15, 0–30, 0–60, 0–100, and 0 ≥ 100 cm, after land conversion to agroforestry. Data was collected from 53 published studies. Results revealed a significant decrease in SOC stocks of 26 and 24% in the land-use change from forest to agroforestry at 0–15 and 0–30 cm respectively. The transition from agriculture to agroforestry significantly increased SOC stock of 26, 40, and 34% at 0–15, 0–30, and 0–100 cm respectively. The conversion from pasture/grassland to agroforestry produced significant SOC stock increases at 0–30 cm (9%) and 0–30 cm (10%). Switching from uncultivated/other land-uses to agroforestry increased SOC by 25% at 0–30 cm, while a decrease was observed at 0–60 cm (23%). Among agroforestry systems, significant SOC stocks increases were reported at various soil horizons and depths in the land-use change from agriculture to agrisilviculture and to silvopasture, pasture/grassland to agrosilvopastoral systems, forest to silvopasture, forest plantation to silvopasture, and uncultivated/other to agrisilviculture. On the other hand, significant decreases were observed in the transition from forest to agrisilviculture, agrosilvopastoral and silvopasture systems, and uncultivated/other to silvopasture. Overall, SOC stocks increased when land-use changed from less complex systems, such as agricultural systems. However, heterogeneity, inconsistencies in study design, lack of standardized sampling procedures, failure to report variance estimators, and lack of important explanatory variables, may have influenced the outcomes.},

We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {Westudiedcarbon and radiocarbon content in three historical time series of soil profiles from sites with different histories in the Parangalitsa biosphere, Rila mountains (Bulgaria). Our aim was to understand the consequences of forest regrowth in Eastern European forests for C stocks in the medium and long term. Disturbance history of the area has been studied in detail in recent decades, and we were therefore able to assess the impact of natural events such as windthrows and insect outbreaks on soil C stocks. By combining unique historical profile data with radiocarbon measurements, we obtained a picture of the kinetics at three different sites. These sites were 1) no land use change but an old (>120 years) forest subjected to decades old disturbances from the secondary consequences of a windthrow, 2) a forest site subjected to decades old disturbances from the direct consequences of a windthrow and 3) a grassland converted to forest. While the difference between direct and indirect disturbance did not have a relevant effect on C stocks, the ecological successions triggered either by afforestation or by disturbances caused similar dynamics of SOC decrease followed by accumulation, according to the pattern of primary productivity. The accumulation was marked in the conversion, and clearly involved the subsoil layers as well, leading to a C sequestration considered durable. The huge economic and social changes happening in Eastern Europe in the last two decades have generated a clear trend towards afforestation of lands that were formerly cultivated. The SOC changes from grassland to forest use in these areas (?50?t?ha??1) represented a doubling in stocks in less than 40?years, and their impact on a global scale could represent an unexpected C sink.},

abstract = {A mechanistic model of grassland dynamics is used to simulate fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in European grasslands. The simulations refer to five sites belonging to a monitoring network setup within the framework of the European Union project GREENGRASS. Simulated gross primary productivity ranges from 0.4 to 1.9 kg C m-2year-1depending on environmental conditions and management. Ecosystem respiration is calculated in the order of 0.7-1.5 kg C m-2year-1, resulting in a net CO2uptake of about 0.3 kg C m-2year-1, in reasonable agreement with observations. Linear relationships between ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity, as well as between net primary productivity and annual precipitation are indicated by the simulations. Annual emissions of N2O are predicted in the range of 1-5 kg N ha-1year-1, a factor of 2-10 higher than observed. This is caused by an overestimation of the background fluxes. On the other hand, the model fails to faithfully reproduce timing, duration and magnitude of peak emissions triggered by the application of mineral and organic fertilizers and by rain events. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our results provide new support, based on the dynamics of the ecosystem, for the view of fairy circles as a selforganization phenomenon driven by water-vegetation interactions. The study further suggests that fairy circle birth and death processes correspond to spatially confined transitions between alternative stable states. Cascades of such transitions, possible in various patternforming systems, result in gradual rather than abrupt regime shifts.},

Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30–150 µm pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.},

abstract = {Strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but ecosystem process-based integration of climate change, enhanced CO2, disturbance from fire, and management actions at regional scales are extremely limited. Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon's net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72% of total emissions in 2011–2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase NECB 56% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m3{\textperiodcentered}y−1. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Our analysis framework provides a template for assessments in other temperate regions.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon measurements are frequently used to model the turnover of soil organic carbon (OC) fractions. The assumption of homogeneous turnover in these fractions is typically stated, but consequences of its violation have not been tested. We used samples of a repeated soil inventory of a German beech forest from the litter layer to 50cm depth in 2004 and 2009 to determine the suitability of short-term repeated radiocarbon inventories for estimating the turnover times of OC in soil fractions. Samples from 0-5 and 10-20cm soil depth were density separated into a free light fraction (fLF), an occluded light fraction (oLF), and a heavy, mineral-associated fraction (HF). Samples were analysed for radiocarbon (??14C), OC, and total nitrogen (TN) contents.Similar portions of OC were stored in the HF, but contributions of fLF and oLF varied between study years, probably due to interannual variations or methodological constraints. Following declining atmospheric CO2-14C, also ??14C values at 0-5cm depth declined significantly between 2004 and 2009. Exchange of old for new OC was largest in the fLF and smallest in the HF, which confirms slow turnover of OC associated with minerals. Model results revealed that turnover time estimates based on single-pool models were not in agreement with observed changes in any of the fractions, suggesting all of them to be mixtures, to varying degrees, of fast and slow cycling pools. While single-pool models suggest average turnover times of 115years for HF-OC at 0-5cm depth, thus being a stable fraction, fitting a two-pool model to the two-point measurements of radiocarbon suggested the presence of a fast cycling pool of 15-25years of turnover time. It was however only possible to constrain the portion of this fast pool as being between 50 and 85% of total HF-OC. Increasing ??14C in bulk soil and density fractions between study years at 10-20cm depth suggest that OC enters deeper soil layers with a longer time lag than topsoil layers, e.g., by slow transport, and 5years was not enough to induce significant changes.Even 40. years after the bomb peak, radiocarbon time series are still suitable to detect OC fractions of decadal turnover and hint at time lags and translocation processes. Nevertheless, they do not allow for fixing the portions of fast and slow cycling OC in two-pool models and their turnover times.},

abstract = {We developed a microbial-enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model, based on the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, that describes the dynamics of physically defined pools of soil organic matter (SOC). These include particulate, mineral-associated, dissolved organic matter (POC, MOC, and DOC, respectively), microbial biomass, and associated exoenzymes. The ranges and/or distributions of parameters were determined by both analytical steady-state and dynamic analyses with SOC data from the literature. We used an improved multi-objective parameter sensitivity analysis (MOPSA) to identify the most important parameters for the full model: maintenance of microbial biomass, turnover and synthesis of enzymes, and carbon use efficiency (CUE). The model predicted that an increase of 2 degrees C (baseline temperature 12 degrees C) caused the pools of POC-cellulose, MOC, and total SOC to increase with dynamic CUE and decrease with constant CUE, as indicated by the 50% confidence intervals. Regardless of dynamic or constant CUE, the changes in pool size of POC, MOC, and total SOC varied from -8% to 8% under +2 degrees C. The scenario analysis using a single parameter set indicates that higher temperature with dynamic CUE might result in greater net increases in both POC-cellulose and MOC pools. Different dynamics of various SOC pools reflected the catalytic functions of specific enzymes targeting specific substrates and the interactions between microbes, enzymes, and SOC. With the feasible parameter values estimated in this study, models incorporating fundamental principles of microbial-enzyme dynamics can lead to simulation results qualitatively different from traditional models with fast/slow/passive pools.},

abstract = {Methods to quantify organic carbon (OC) in soil fractions of different stabilities often involve time-consuming physical and chemical treatments. The aim of the present study was to test a more rapid alternative, which is based on the spectroscopic analysis of bulk soils in the mid-infrared region (4000-400 cm-1), combined with partial least-squares regression (PLS). One hundred eleven soil samples from arable and grassland sites across Switzerland were separated into fractions of dissolved OC, particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates, silt and clay particles, and oxidation resistant OC. Measured contents of OC in each fraction were then correlated by PLS with infrared spectra to obtain prediction models. For every prediction model, 100 soil spectra were used in the PLS calibration and the residual 11 spectra for validation of the models. Correlation coefficients (r) between measured and PLS-predicted values ranged between 0.89 and 0.97 for OC in different fractions. By combining different fractions to one labile, one stabilized and one resistant fraction, predictions could even be improved (r = 0.98, standard error of prediction=16%). Based on these statistical parameters, we conclude that mid-infrared spectroscopy in combination with PLS is an appropriate and very fast tool to quantify OC contents in different soil fractions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unclear what specific root traits contribute to the three SOM stabilization mechanisms: recalcitrance against decomposition, occlusion in soil aggregates and interaction with soil minerals and metals. This is likely because research is highly fragmented and hampered by disciplinary barriers. By reviewing both plant functional ecology and soil science literature, we identified 18 different traits: architectural, morphological, physiological, symbiotic and chemical root characteristics, influencing the three SOM stabilization mechanisms. We found that traits increasing root recalcitrance promote short term stabilization by slowing decomposition, but that traits reducing recalcitrance contribute to long term stabilization by reaction of microbial products with mineral surfaces. Root length density, mycorrhizal association and rhizodeposition contribute to microaggregation. These and other traits, such as hemicellulose, soluble compounds, and high root branching index, favor macroaggregation. For stabilization by minerals and metals, those root traits promoting higher microbial activity: root nitrogen, hemicellulose and soluble compound concentrations are fundamental, while polyphenols, and litter Al and Mn also contribute to complexification and stabilization. Root depth distribution is the most important trait to control root C storage and stabilization in the subsoil; once roots have reached deeper soil layers, other traits, such as rhizodeposition and root chemistry, influence interaction with minerals and metals. Both mycorrhizal presence and root suberin promote SOC stabilization by means of all three mechanisms, indicating that these are important targets for continued work. Surprisingly, morphological traits commonly measured, namely specific root length and root diameter, poorly relate to stabilization mechanisms. Alternative traits such as chemical composition of the different root orders, root apex characteristics, quantity and quality of rhizodeposits as well as mycorrhizal fungal traits, should be further investigated. For future research, this review highlights the need to evaluate root decomposition and root-C stabilization concomitantly over the long-term, considering simultaneously root litter quality, estimated by root traits, the microbial products and properties of the soil matrix. The information accrued in this review can be used to evaluate the potential of plant species and cultivars to promote SOM stabilization, based on their root traits.},

abstract = {Forest harvest operations often produce large amounts of harvest residue which typically becomes fine (foliage, small limbs and trees) and coarse woody debris (snags and downed logs). If removed at harvest, residual biomass has potential to be a local energy source and to produce marketable biofuel feedstock. But, CWD in particular serves critical life-history functions (e.g., breeding, foraging, basking) for a variety of organisms. Unfortunately, little is known about how forest biodiversity would respond to large scale removal of harvest residues. We calculated 745 biodiversity effect sizes from 26 studies involving manipulations of CWD (i.e., removed or added downed woody debris and/or snags). Diversity and abundance of both cavity- and open-nesting birds were substantially and consistently lower in treatments with lower amounts of downed CWD and/or standing snags, as was biomass of invertebrates. However, cumulative effect sizes for other taxa were not as large, were based on fewer studies, and varied among manipulation types. Little is currently known about biodiversity response to harvest of fine woody debris. Predicting the effects of biomass harvests on forest biodiversity is uncertain at best until more is known about how operational harvests actually change fine and coarse woody debris levels over long time periods. Pilot biomass harvests report post-harvest changes in CWD levels much smaller than the experimental changes involved in the studies we analyzed. Thus, operational biomass harvests may not change CWD levels enough to appreciably influence forest biodiversity, especially when following biomass harvest guidelines that require leaving a portion of harvest residues. Multi-scale studies can help reduce this uncertainty by investigating how biodiversity responses scale from the small scale of manipulative experiments (i.e., 10-ha plots) to operational forest management and how biodiversity response to CWD levels might vary at different spatial and temporal scales and in different landscape contexts. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we use 19962009 data from the four Swedish Integrated Monitoring catchments to evaluate how the declining sulfur deposition has affected sulfate, pH, acid neutralizing capacity, ionic strength, aluminum, and dissolved organic carbon in soil water, groundwater and runoff. Differences in recovery rates between catchments, between recharge and discharge areas and between soil water and groundwater are assessed. At the IM sites, atmospheric deposition is the main human impact. The chemical trends were weakly correlated to the sulfur deposition decline. Other factors, such as marine influence and catchment features, seem to be as important. Except for pH and DOC, soil water and groundwater showed similar trends. Discharge areas acted as buffers, dampening the trends in streamwater. Further monitoring and modeling of these hydraulically active sites should be encouraged. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Swedish Academy of Science.},

abstract = {This paper examines uncertainties in the interpretation of isotope signals when estimating fine root longevity, particularly in forests. The isotope signals are depleted {\^{I}}´13C values from elevated CO2 experiments and enriched {\^{I}}”14C values from bomb 14C in atmospheric CO2. For the CO2 experiments, I explored the effects of six root mortality patterns (on-off, proportional, constant, normal, left skew, and right skew distributions), five levels of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves, and increased root growth on root {\^{I}}´13C values after CO2 fumigation. My analysis indicates that fitting a linear equation to {\^{I}}´13C data provides unbiased estimates of longevity only if root mortality follows an on-off model, without dilution of isotope signals by pretreatment NSC reserves, and under a steady state between growth and death. If root mortality follows the other patterns, the linear extrapolation considerably overestimates root longevity. In contrast, fitting an exponential equation to {\^{I}}´13C data underestimates longevity with all the mortality patterns except the proportional one. With either linear or exponential extrapolation, dilution of isotope signals by pretreatment NSC reserves could result in overestimation of root longevity by several-fold. Root longevity is underestimated if elevated CO2 stimulates fine root growth. For the bomb 14C approach, I examined the effects of four mortality patterns (on-off, proportional, constant, and normal distribution) on root {\^{I}}”14C values. For a given {\^{I}}”14C value, the proportional pattern usually provides a shorter estimate of root longevity than the other patterns. Overall, we have to improve our understanding of root growth and mortality patterns and to measure NSC reserves in order to reduce uncertainties in estimated fine root longevity from isotope data.},

abstract = {Mathematical models do not explicitly represent the influence of soil microbial diversity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics despite recent evidence of relationships between them. The objective of the present study was to statistically investigate relationships between bacterial and fungal diversity indexes (richness, evenness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and decomposition of different pools of soil organic carbon by measuring dynamics of CO2 emissions under controlled conditions. To this end, 20 soils from two different land uses (cropland and grassland) were incubated with or without incorporation of 13C-labelled wheat-straw residue. 13C-labelling allowed us to study residue mineralisation, basal respiration and the priming effect independently. An innovative data-mining approach was applied, based on generalized additive models and a predictive criterion. Results showed that microbial diversity indexes can be good covariates to integrate in SOC dynamics models, depending on the C source and the processes considered (native soil organic carbon vs. fresh wheat residue). Specifically, microbial diversity indexes were good candidates to help explain mineralisation of native soil organic carbon, while priming effect processes seemed to be explained much more by microbial composition, and no microbial diversity indexes were found associated with residue mineralisation. Investigation of relationships between diversity and mineralisation showed that higher diversity, as measured by the microbial diversity indexes, seemed to be related to decreased CO2 emissions in the control soil. We suggest that this relationship can be explained by an increase in carbon yield assimilation as microbial diversity increases. Thus, the parameter for carbon yield assimilation in mathematical models could be calculated as a function of microbial diversity indexes. Nonetheless, given limitations of the methods used, these observations should be considered with caution and confirmed with more experimental studies. Overall, along with other studies on relationships between microbial community composition and SOM dynamics, this study suggests that overall measures of microbial diversity may constitute relevant ways to include microbial diversity in models of SOM dynamics.},

A reciprocal linear-logarithmic function was found to fit the spatial trend of RLD, and was subtracted from the original data for correct application of geostatistics. Subsequent use of variography enabled description of the relations of root density with space and provided information on the size of root clusters. Spatial relations also served as a basis for subsequent estimation by kriging of RLD in unsampled locations, thus yielding bi-dimensional RLD maps with higher accuracy than those obtained by traditional methods of interpolation. Comparing two maize hybrids of different yields, the maps showed substantial differences in the proportion of root length in peripheral positions of the cross-row vertical profile and in the incidence of zones with critical density of colonisation. The trend of variograms also indicated larger root clusters in the higher-yielding hybrid, together with more uniform colonisation of soil-a profitable feature in conditions of limited soil resources. The trial highlighted some drawbacks in the application of geostatistics to feasible schemes of soil-coring in wide-spaced crops.},

abstract = {The broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate (common trade name "Roundup") was first sold to farmers in 1974. Since the late 1970s, the volume of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied has increased approximately 100-fold. Further increases in the volume applied are likely due to more and higher rates of application in response to the widespread emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and new, pre-harvest, dessicant use patterns. GBHs were developed to replace or reduce reliance on herbicides causing well-documented problems associated with drift and crop damage, slipping efficacy, and human health risks. Initial industry toxicity testing suggested that GBHs posed relatively low risks to non-target species, including mammals, leading regulatory authorities worldwide to set high acceptable exposure limits. To accommodate changes in GBH use patterns associated with genetically engineered, herbicide-tolerant crops, regulators have dramatically increased tolerance levels in maize, oilseed (soybeans and canola), and alfalfa crops and related livestock feeds. Animal and epidemiology studies published in the last decade, however, point to the need for a fresh look at glyphosate toxicity. Furthermore, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer recently concluded that glyphosate is "probably carcinogenic to humans." In response to changing GBH use patterns and advances in scientific understanding of their potential hazards, we have produced a Statement of Concern drawing on emerging science relevant to the safety of GBHs. Our Statement of Concern considers current published literature describing GBH uses, mechanisms of action, toxicity in laboratory animals, and epidemiological studies. It also examines the derivation of current human safety standards. We conclude that: (1) GBHs are the most heavily applied herbicide in the world and usage continues to rise; (2) Worldwide, GBHs often contaminate drinking water sources, precipitation, and air, especially in agricultural regions; (3) The half-life of glyphosate in water and soil is longer than previously recognized; (4) Glyphosate and its metabolites are widely present in the global soybean supply; (5) Human exposures to GBHs are rising; (6) Glyphosate is now authoritatively classified as a probable human carcinogen; (7) Regulatory estimates of tolerable daily intakes for glyphosate in the United States and European Union are based on outdated science. We offer a series of recommendations related to the need for new investments in epidemiological studies, biomonitoring, and toxicology studies that draw on the principles of endocrinology to determine whether the effects of GBHs are due to endocrine disrupting activities. We suggest that common commercial formulations of GBHs should be prioritized for inclusion in government-led toxicology testing programs such as the U.S. National Toxicology Program, as well as for biomonitoring as conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.},

abstract = {Uneven-aged forest management is suggested to be a sustainable management alternative in boreal forests, but knowledge on applicable harvest intensities is very limited as majority of the studies has focused on even-aged management practices. The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10–30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8–16 m2 ha−1). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m−2 a−1 of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5–20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m3 ha−1 for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5–7 m3 ha−1 a−1) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80–120 m3 ha−1 was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40–60 m3 ha−1. The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important natural resource. It is fundamental to soil and ecosystem functions across a wide range of scales, from site-specific soil fertility and water holding capacity to global biogeochemical cycling. It is also a highly complex material that is sensitive to direct and indirect human impacts. In SOM research, simulation models play an important role by providing a mathematical framework to integrate, examine, and test the understanding of SOM dynamics. Simulation models of SOM are also increasingly used in more 'applied' settings to evaluate human impacts on ecosystem function, and to manage SOM for greenhouse gas mitigation, improved soil health, and sustainable use as a natural resource. Within this context, there is a need to maintain a robust connection between scientific developments in SOM modeling approaches and SOM model applications. This need forms the basis of this review. In this review we first provide an overview of SOM modeling, focusing on SOM theory, data-model integration, and model development as evidenced by a quantitative review of SOM literature. Second, we present the landscape of SOM model applications, focusing on examples in climate change policy. We conclude by discussing five areas of recent developments in SOM modeling including: (1) microbial roles in SOM stabilization; (2) modeling SOM saturation kinetics; (3) temperature controls on decomposition; (4) SOM dynamics in deep soil layers; and (5) SOM representation in earth system models. Our aim is to comprehensively connect SOM model development to its applications, revealing knowledge gaps in need of focused interdisciplinary attention and exposing pitfalls that, if avoided, can lead to best use of SOM models to support policy initiatives and sustainable land management solutions.},

abstract = {The collapse of socialism in 1989 triggered a phase of institutional restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe. Several countries chose to privatize forests or to return them to pre-socialist owners. Here, we assess the implications of forest restitution on the terrestrial carbon balance. New forest owners have strong incentives to immediately clearcut their forests, resulting in increased terrestrial emissions. On the other hand, logging generally decreased after 1989 and forests are expanding on unused or abandoned farmland, both of which may offset increased logging on restituted forests. We mapped changes in forest cover for the entire country of Romania using Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2010. We use our satellite estimates, together with historic data on logging rates and changes in forest cover, to parameterize a carbon book-keeping model for estimating the terrestrial carbon flux (above and below ground) as a consequence of land use change and forest harvest. High logging rates during socialism resulted in substantial terrestrial carbon emissions and Romania was a net carbon source until the 1980s. After the collapse of the Soviet Union forest harvest rates decreased dramatically, but since restitution laws were implemented they have increased by 60% (from 15 122 ± 5397 ha y − 1 in 2000 to 23 884 ± 11 510 ha y − 1 in 2010), but still remain lower than prior to 1989. Romania currently remains a terrestrial carbon sink, offsetting 7.6% ± 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. A further increase in logging could result in net emissions from terrestrial ecosystems during the coming decades. However, forest expansion on degraded land and abandoned farmland offers great potential for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {It has been observed in numerical simulations that a weight decay can improve generalization in a feed-forward neural network. This paper explains why. It is proven that a weight decay has two effects in a linear network. First, it suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vector by choosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem. Second, if the size is chosen right, a weight decay can suppress some of the effects of static noise on the targets, which improves generalization quite a lot. It is then shown how to extend these results to networks with hidden layers and non-linear units. Finally the theory is confirmed by some numerical simulations using the data from NetTalk. 1 INTRODUCTION Many recent studies have shown that the generalization ability of a neural network (or any other `learning machine') depends on a balance between the information in the training examples and the complexity of the network, see for instance [1,2,3].

Motivated by the concept of ecological resilience, we propose a novel and pragmatic measure called 'integral stabilitya' which integrates different aspects commonly addressed separately by existing local and global stability concepts. We demonstrate the potential of integral stability by using exemplary multistable dynamical systems such as the damped driven pendulum, a model of Amazonian rainforest as a known climate tipping element and the Daisyworld model. A crucial feature of integral stability lies in its potential of arresting a gradual loss of the stability of a system when approaching a tipping point, thus providing a potential early-warning signal sufficiently prior to a qualitative change of the system's dynamics.},

abstract = {Predictive models were developed for Cordia alliodora branch and Theobroma cacao branch or leaf biomass,based on branch basal areas (r2 ≥ 0.79) but the model of C. alliodora leaf biomass, although significant, was of very low accuracy (r2 = 0.09) due to annual leaf fall. At age 10 years, shade tree stem biomass accounted for 80% of the total above-ground biomass of either tree. However, between the ages of 6 and 10 years, the biomass increment of T. cacao branches (3-4t.ha-1.a-1) was similar to that of the shade tree stems. During the same period, the net primary productivity was 35 and 28 t.ha-1.a-1, for the Erythrina poepigiana and and C. alliodora systems, respectively. Cocoa production under either of the shade trees C. alliodora or E. poeppigiana was 1000 kg.ha-1.a-1 (oven-dry; ages 6-10 yr). During the same period, C. alliodora timber production was 9 m3.ha-1.a-1 whilst the leguminous shade tree E. poeppigiana does not produce timber. Litterfall over the same 5 years, including crop and/or shade tree pruning residues, averages 11 and 23 t.ha-1.a-1, respectively. The main difference was due to E. poeppigiana pruning residues (10t.ha-1.a-1). Soil organic material reserves (0-45 cm) increased over 10 years from 198 to 240 t.ha-1 in the E. poeppigiana plots and from 168-184 t.ha-1 in the C. alliodora plots. These values, together with the productivity indices presented, provide evidence that the systems are sustainable. For economic reasons, the use of C. alliodora is recommended under the experimental conditions. however, on less fertile soils without fertilization, the greater biomass and hence nutrient return to the soil surface under E. poeppigiana, might make this the preferable shade tree. {\textcopyright} 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{Phillips2009,
abstract = {Several recent theories and conceptual frameworks in pedology, ecology, geomorphology, and evolutionary biology, taken together, suggest the notion that earth's soils are not just strongly influenced by biota, but represent selective pressures. These ideas point in the direction of many aspects of soils as expressions of the effects of genes through the effects of organisms (i.e., extended phenotypes). The cumulative, interacting, overlapping effects of these extended phenotypes as manifested in the soil represent an extended composite phenotype. If this is the case, then we should expect major changes in biological evolution to be reflected in major changes in the types of soils. A brief review of paleopedology literature supports the notion of coevolution of soils and biota, not just in the sense of both responding to the same environmental forcings, but also with respect to explicit pedological expressions of biological change. The extended composite phenotype notion also suggests that significant biological changes should be reflected in significant qualitative pedological changes (i.e., fundamental changes in soil morphology beyond quantitative changes in specific short-lived soil properties). This is demonstrated via recent research in the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, where changes in selective pressures on trees associated with fire frequency are linked to changes in soil morphology. The concept of soils as extended composite phenotypes has repercussions for pedology, evolutionary biology, and interpretations of soils in other earth and environmental sciences. The notion of genetic signatures in soil morphology also has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, and extends the notion of Earth as a set of tightly-coupled, densely interwoven systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Parent material can deeply influence soil organic matter (SOM) stocks. In this study we tested the hypotheses that parent material had an effect on SOM concentrations and stocks and that this effect may be explained by the influence of soil parent material on basic soil parameters. However, as the factors known to influence SOM stocks such as land use and climate frequently co-vary with geology, testing the influence on SOM stocks of the factor ???soil parent material??? alone is challenging. To properly test our hypotheses, we studied SOM stocks of forest and cropland soils in a small landscape (17??km2) of the Paris basin (France), i.e. with an homogeneous climate. We collected topsoil samples (0???30??cm) in 50 forest and cropland plots, located in five geological contexts: loess deposit, mudstone, grainstone, chalk and calcareous clay deposits. Basic soil parameters (texture, pH, CaCO3 concentration) and SOM stocks to 30??cm depth (organic C and total N) were determined on the 50 soil samples. Organic C and total N concentrations and stocks in topsoils (0???30??cm) were much higher in forests than in cultivated soils (38.1 (????12.8) vs. 19.0 (????4.7)??g??C??kg?????1 soil and 83.4 (????19.8) vs 48.9 (????9.9)??t??C??ha?????1 for SOC concentrations and stocks respectively). The influence of land-use on organic C and total N concentrations and stocks was modulated by parent material (significant interactions between land-use and parent material, p??<??0.05 for concentrations and stocks). Indeed, the difference in organic C and total N concentrations and stocks in topsoils (0???30??cm) was much lower for soils developed on loess deposits. While SOC concentration was significantly correlated to soil clay concentration for both cropland (r2??=??0.36, p??<??0.001) and forest (r2??=??0.44, p??<??0.001), there was no significant relation between SOC stocks and soil clay stocks for forest soil (p??=??0.11) and a significant but highly scattered positive correlation between SOC and clay stocks in cropland soils (r2??=??0.20, p??=??0.02). No significant relation between pH or CaCO3 and SOC stocks was observed. Our results therefore revealed that soil parent material can significantly influence topsoil (0???30??cm) organic C and N stocks but that more research is needed to understand how soil parent material influences SOM stocks as it cannot be simply explained by basic soil physico-chemical parameters (clay and carbonate concentrations or stocks, pH). Overall, our results suggest that a good knowledge of the geology is needed to better constrain SOC stocks as well as SOC stocks evolution in a changing environment from landscape to global scale.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient +¦ to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). +¦ is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-+¦d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of +¦ correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (+¦=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80-90% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles (+¦=0.975 and 0.976, respectively) and had only 50% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil. (+¦=0.952), while shrubs had only 21% in the same depth increment (+¦=0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was +¦=0.970 with 26% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was +¦=0.966 (r2=0.89) with approximately 30%, 50%, and 75% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits and possible shortcomings of our analysis in the context of root biomass and root functioning.},

abstract = {For many decades in the late 20th century, the processes involved in the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) (also known as humification) constituted one of the most important areas of scientific inquiry in soil science. However, these processes have not been included in modern models of SOM dynamics, despite their relevance to quantifying carbon stabilisation (i.e., sequestration) in soil. Furthermore, modern models have focussed on mineralisation processes (e.g., mainly microbial heterotrophic respiration) and have not included the important effects of soil fauna that are known as key agents of SOM formation. To address these issues, we developed a modelling approach predicated on the existence of definable stoichiometric relations among the processes leading to SOM formation that are mediated by soil biota (e.g., correlations among biotic respiration, production of faunal excrement, and necromass as sources of SOM formation). Soil respiration, a core rate variable in all SOM models, was associated with the production of faunal by-products in soil food webs as precursors of stable SOM, specifically micro- and meso-faunal excrement, necromass, and earthworm casts. We developed a food-web based module, using a synthesis of decades of published data, to describe micro- and meso-faunal excrement and necromass production. We developed a separate module for anecic earthworms, with explicit representation of processes related to fresh casts. The contributions of these two modules were compiled and integrated with the ROMUL model of SOM dynamics, without changing the structure of the original model. These modules enabled calculation of the proportional contribution of faunal by-products to humification (i.e., recalcitrant SOM formation) and carbon sequestration. Testing of the new version of the model, known as Romul_Hum, showed consistent accumulation of faunal by-products in the “final” SOM fractions: the well-decomposed SOM of the organic soil horizons and the stable SOM of the mineral soil.},

abstract = {Executive Summary\nSECTION A: DEER DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURE\nBACKGROUND\n� A brief review of the interactions between deer and agriculture revealed that\nhistorically the "red deer problem" was mainly caused by deer marauding\nagricultural ground. Since the formation of the RDC in 1959 this problem has\nbeen viewed as less serious than the threat of deer to forestry and the need to\nreduce the population size on deer forest ground.\n� The DCS has the necessary powers and duties to carry out action to protect\nenclosed agricultural ground as defined in the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996.\nREVIEW OF CURRENT INFORMATION\n� The only systematically collected data available to us on the extent of deer\ndamage to agriculture is the number of out-of-season shooting Authorisations held\non the DCS database. Additional information was collected by a postal\nquestionnaire to the secretaries of each Deer Management Group and phone\nconversations with staff from the DCS and the National Farmers Union.\n� It seems likely, from the literature, that damage by deer to agricultural fields will\nbe confined to fields immediately adjacent to woodland or other suitable cover.\nFurther more, most damage will be on the boundary edges of fields close to\nwoodland. Within fields damage tends to be patchy and within a distinct 'zone' of\nutilisation.\n� No Scottish study has researched the direct effect of deer damage on agricultural\ncrops.\n� The timing of damage dictates if serious economic loss will ensue. Winter and\nspring grazing of cereals may actually lead to greater tillering and potentially\ngreater yield. Grazing damage just prior to harvesting may have economic\nconsequences but damage by animals trampling and flattening cereals may be less\nthan perceived due to modern harvesting machines.\n� Winter damage to root crops can have serious economic consequences. Most\nstudies have concluded that damage to crops by roe deer is not economically\nsignificant. Although not measured, deer grazing of early spring grass could cause\nreduced milk production for dairy farmers.\n� In Scotland marauding red deer come down off open hill ground in winter and\nspring to raid crops, but can be shot legally by agricultural owners and occupiers.\n� Woodland within or adjacent to farmland is also an important habitat for deer,\nusing it for cover and to lie up during the day..2\n� Use of farm crops is seasonal in Scotland with fields of cereals, grasslands and\noilseed rape important in spring, peas and beet in summer and root crops\nimportant in autumn and winter. Stubble fields are important in autumn and winter\nbut use of these fields may depend on the type of crop recently harvested.\n� Cereals have been shown to be an important component of roe deer diet in\nScottish farmland. Despite little research on the diet of other deer species in\nagricultural land in Scotland evidence from other countries suggests that grasses\nwould form a large proportion of the diet. These grasses might well include\nspecies found in improved grassland.\n� The use of damage categories changed during the lifetime of the Out-of-season\nShooting Authorisation database making a proper analysis difficult and we are\nunable to present annual trends on a regional basis.\nCOSTS OF PROTECTION AND DAMAGE\n� In the ADAS questionnaire of farmers from lowland England culling was\nperceived to be the most effective form of damage prevention. In the same\nquestionnaire the costs of protection for farm holdings was less than �500 in most\ncases.\n� Most farmers in lowland England attributed a cost of less than �500 per annum to\ndeer damage.\n� Estimated costs of damage by rabbits and Greylag geese are currently much\ngreater than those for deer.\nCONCLUSIONS\n� A closer monitoring of the "agricultural cull" could be useful for estimating the\n"size" of the "agricultural problem" as authorisations per se do not give an\nadequate estimate of the problem.\n� Farmers` perceptions on cost of damage could be collected by a questionnaire. In\nsome areas this may also help increase farmers awareness about the DCS and its\nrole.\n� The European policies of removing farmland from production and replacing them\nwith woodland is bound to lead to an increase in deer on farmland and could\npotentially lead to greater damage..3\nSECTION B: DEER DAMAGE TO FORESTRY\n� Despite seemingly making up little of the annual diet of deer a high proportion of\nyoung conifers are eaten during winter and spring with one study suggesting\nincreased use in summer as well.\n� So far as we know tree bark has never been found in any of the dietary studies of\nred and sika deer in this country, and the study of Jackson (1977) is the only\ninstance we found where bark was found in the diet of fallow. This suggests that\nbark-stripping is an insignificant element of deer diet, yet it is without doubt the\nmain concern of foresters.\nEFFECTS OF BROWSING\n� Different tree species have varying susceptibility and periods of vulnerability to\nleader browsing. Most browsed Sitka spruce are smaller than 80 cm despite deer\nspecies being able to reach much higher.\n� The effect of browsing on leading shoots is generally believed to be more serious\nthan on side shoots. Crops may have their growth checked, become deformed by\nmultiple stemming or structural defects to timber may occur.\n� Growth of trees is checked by browsing and the length of time a species is\nchecked depends partly on trees species.\n� The more times trees are browsed in early life the greater the chance that these\ntrees will become permanently multiple stemmed.\n� Multiple stemmed trees have similar survival but poorer growth compared with\nsingle stemmed trees. Although many multiple stemmed trees ultimately become\nsingle stemmed as weaker trunks die, many still remain deformed at harvesting.\nEFFECTS OF BARK STRIPPING\n� Tree species have different vulnerability to bark stripping, with Norway spruce\nand Lodgepole pine particularly vulnerable. Wound size also varies between\nspecies with Norway spruce receiving both more and larger wounds than Sitka\nspruce.\n� Wounds are generally restricted to the bottom 1.5 m of stems. Once a tree has\nbeen damaged it is likely to be damaged again thus reducing the overall impact of\nbark stripping.\n� At Glenbranter most wounds on Sitka spruce are small and heal within 8 years,\nand only 1% of Sitka showed signs of rot on wounds compared with 11% for\nNorway spruce..� Loss of growth following bark stripping may happen in some species. In many\nspecies damaged trees have similar survival to undamaged tree but Lodgepole\npine are particularly prone to stem breakage at the point of wounding.\n� Norway spruce is particularly vulnerable to development of stain and rot\nfollowing bark stripping. Most research on Sitka spruce suggests it does not suffer\nsevere stain and decay\n� From an initial estimate that 27% of Sitka spruce trees at Glenbranter would be\nbark stripped by the time of harvesting, this figure was reduced to only 14 % of\nthe best trees, as mainly it is the small less valuable trees that are damaged. A\nstand value at the time of felling estimated site losses of between 9-11% in value.\nBecause only large wounds have a potential economic impact at the time of\nharvesting, down grading estimates based on rejection rates of sawn timber and\ntimber strength tests meant the actual financial loss would be only 2-3% of stand\nvalue.\nEFFECTS OF FRAYING\n� Fraying damage is generally regarded to be economically less serious than the\nother forms of deer damage.\nCOSTS OF PROTECTION AND DAMAGE\n� In 1991-92 the cost of employing forest rangers was �2.03 million while venison\nreturns brought in �1.26 million in that year. Rangers do not spend all their time\non deer control and if 60% of their time was spent on this task the cost would have\nbeen �1.22 million.\n� Current costs of fencing are between �4-10 per metre depending on terrain and\ntype of fencing. The costs of other methods such as chemical repellents and\nindividual protection are even more cost prohibitive.\n� For trees planted since 1978 in Glenbranter we estimate using current figures that\nthe losses due to deer damage will range from 7.8% to 17.3% for yield class 12\nSitka spruce the most common yield class in the forest. (Yield class being an\nestimate of stem volume per ha per year).\n� More data are required on the economic costs of damage both for more tree\nspecies and from a wider selection of forests.\nCURRENT ISSUES\n� Current issues identified include deer fencing, regeneration of semi-natural\nwoodland and increased planting of farm woodlands.},

abstract = {1.This review assesses current knowledge about the interplay between landscape and pollinator communities. Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation. 2.Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities. 3.Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management. 4.The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives. 5.Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from two organic soil plots in central Sweden between 2012 and 2016 using the eddy covariance technique. One site was cultivated whilst the other was set aside with no cultivation occurring. The aim was to establish the impact that cultivation had on the carbon balance. Over the five year period the set aside field acted as a net carbon source whilst the cultivated site was seen to be a small carbon sink. The set aside was further seen to act as a small methane sink over a 36 month period, which reduced the CO2source by ca. 10% in terms of CO2equivalents. Considering exported biomass, both sites were carbon sources in terms of Net Biome Production (NBP).},

@article{Shahbaz2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V. The relationship between carbon (C) inputs and nitrogen (N) fertilisation is a key element of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, which remains poorly resolved. In temperate climates, it is critical to investigate the interactive effect of C and N inputs on SOM stabilisation under low or high substrate availability. We measured SOM content and in situ soil respiration in a long-term field experiment in Sweden, which started in 1956. In 2000, the previous C3 crops were replaced with C4 maize, making it possible to trace old- (C3-derived) and young-C (C4-derived) sources in CO2 and SOM under bare fallow, maize cropped with or without N-fertilisation (root C-inputs). Soil respiration and its isotopic composition were measured in the field prior to sowing, every second week during crop growth and once after harvest. During 1956–1999, the bare fallow lost 38% of its SOM, following an exponential decay trend. Despite root C inputs, total SOM content under C3 crops declined from 1.5% in 1956 to 1.4% and 1.2% C in fertilised and unfertilised treatments, respectively, in 1999. After the crop change in 2000, estimated C input increased by 5% (under fertilisation), but SOM content continued to decline (as before 2000), to 1.25% (fertilised) and 1.03% (unfertilised) in 2017. Analysis of $\delta$13C revealed that 9 and 11% of young-C was retained in unfertilised and fertilised SOM, respectively. However, up to 70% of soil respiration derived from young-C. Comparing the contributions of old- and young-C to CO2 and SOM showed that, irrespective to the time of measurement, young-C was always more available for microbial decomposition than old-C, particularly under fertilisation. We conclude that the amount of C entering the soil through root inputs was insufficient to counterbalance SOM losses over time. Moreover, soil nutrient status and recent root-C availability appear to be important for CO2 release, and must be considered in further recommendations on maintaining/improving SOM stocks.},

abstract = {Fine root (<2 mm) cycling rates are important for understanding plant ecology and carbon fluxes in forests, but they are difficult to determine and remain uncertain. This paper synthesizes minirhizotron and isotopic data and a root model and concludes that (1) fine roots have a spectrum of turnover times ranging from months to many years and (2) the mean age of live root biomass (A) and the mean age of roots when they die (i.e., their turnover time ($\tau$)) are not equal. We estimated A and $\tau$ of fine roots in three forests using the root model Radix. For short-lived roots, we constrained $\tau$ with existing minirhizotron data; for long-lived roots, we used new radiocarbon measurements of roots sampled by diameter size class and root branch order. Long-lived root pools had site mean $\tau$ of 8–13 y and 5–9 y when sampled by diameter and branch order, respectively. Mean turnover times across sites were in general not significantly different as a function of branch-order, size class, or depth. Our modeling results indicate that ∼20% of fine root biomass has turnover times of about a year, and ∼80% has decadal turnover times. This partitioning is reflected in our predicted mean ages of ∼9 y and turnover times of ∼3 y. We estimate that fine root mortality contributes between 38 and 104 g C m−2 y−1 to soil in these forests. These estimates are 20 to 80% of previous estimates in these and similar forests, in part because we explicitly account for the large portion of fine-root biomass with decadal cycling rates. Our work shows that both fast and slow cycling roots must be modeled jointly to account for the heterogeneous nature of fine-root dynamics.},

abstract = {Numerous models have been used to express the temperature sensitivity of microbial growth and activity in soil making it difficult to compare results from different habitats. Q10 still is one of the most common way to express temperature relationships. However, Q10 is not constant with temperature and will differ depending on the temperature interval used for the calculation. The use of the square root (Ratkowsky) relationship between microbial activity (A) and temperature below optimum temperature, √A = a x (T-Tmin ), is proposed as a simple and adequate model that allow for one descriptor, Tmin (a theoretical minimum temperature for growth and activity), to estimate correct Q10-values over the entire in situ temperature interval. The square root model can adequately describe both microbial growth and respiration, allowing for an easy determination of Tmin . Q10 for any temperature interval can then be calculated by Q10 = [(T + 10 - Tmin )/(T - Tmin )]2 , where T is the lowest temperature in the Q10 comparison. Tmin also describes the temperature adaptation of the microbial community. An envelope of Tmin covering most natural soil habitats varying between -15°C (cold habitats like Antarctica/Arctic) to 0°C (tropical habitats like rain forests and deserts) is suggested, with an 0.3°C increase in Tmin per 1°C increase in mean annual temperature. It is shown that the main difference between common temperature relationships used in global models are differences in the assumed temperature adaptation of the soil microbial community. Using the square root equation will allow for one descriptor, Tmin , determining the temperature response of soil microorganisms, and at the same time allow for comparing temperature sensitivity of microbial activity between habitats, including future projections.

abstract = {Plant-soil biological interactions are increasingly recognized as a key feature of agroecosystems, promoting both crop and soil health. However, the effectiveness of plant-soil synergies is likely modulated by both root system characteristics and soil management impacts on soil biological communities. To successfully manage for plant-soil interactions, we need to better understand how crops respond to changes in soil management, especially in terms of belowground investment. Specifically, crop genotypes that exhibit reduced plasticity in root growth and investment may not be able to take full advantage of changes in soil biological activity associated with soil health promoting practices. We hypothesized that genotypes with greater belowground investment respond more, in terms of plant growth and crop nitrogen (N) uptake, to compost and earthworm additions, agronomic factors commonly associated with soil health. We evaluated four spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes with distinct breeding and environmental histories, and one progenitor of wheat (Aegilops tauschii) under low soil fertility conditions in the greenhouse for differences in belowground root biomass and architecture. We then determined how these belowground traits influenced genotype response to additions of compost and earthworms. Measurements included plant growth, biomass, grain yield, root characteristics, plant N uptake, and soil N. Overall, in unamended soils, genotypes differed in above and belowground phenotypic traits. In general, Ae. tauschii had three times greater root: shoot (R:S) ratio, root length, and root biomass relative to wheat genotypes. We found that genotypes with higher R:S ratios responded more positively to compost additions compared to those with lower R:S ratios, particularly in terms of plant aboveground biomass, N uptake and soil N-cycling, and also exhibited greater plasticity in root morphology. Consequently, while higher R:S genotypes had relatively poorer yields in unamended soils, they outperformed lower R:S genotypes in total seed weight under compost treatments. Our findings suggest that genotypes with greater belowground investment may be better able to take advantage of soil health promoting practices, such as the use of organic amendments. These results highlight the need to consider soil management practices (and associated biological communities) in parallel with root phenotypic plasticity when evaluating wheat lines for improvements in plant-soil synergies.},

abstract = {A large share, estimated at 12-25%, of the annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to global deforestation. Increasing the forested areas therefore has a positive impact on carbon (C) sequestration and mitigation of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Fast-growing species, such as willow and poplar, are of high interest as producers of biomass for fuel, but also as C sinks. The present study estimated the rate of C sequestration in biomass and soil in willow and poplar plantations. Calculations were based on above- and below-ground biomass production data from field experiments, including fine root turnover, litter decomposition rates, and production levels from commercial plantations. Accumulation of C in woody biomass, above and below ground, was estimated at 76.6-80.1 Mg C ha-1 and accumulation of C in the soil at 9.0-10.3 Mg C ha-1 over the first 20-22 years. The average rates of C sequestration were 3.5-4.0 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in woody biomass, and 0.4-0.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the soil. If 400,000 ha of abandoned arable land in Sweden were planted with willow and poplar, about 1.5 Tg C would be sequestered annually in woody biomass and 0.2 Tg C in soils. This would be nearly one tenth of the annual anthropogenic emissions of C in Sweden today. These calculations show the potential of fast-growing plantations on arable land to mitigate the effect of high CO2 concentrations over a short time span. Knowledge gaps were found during the calculation process and future research areas were suggested. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in increased plant carbon inputs to soil that can accelerate the decomposition of native soil organic matter, an effect known as priming. Consequently, it is important to understand and quantify the priming effect for future predictions of carbon–climate feedbacks. There are potential pitfalls, however, when representing this complex system with a simple, first-order model. Here, we show that a multi-pool soil carbon model can match the change in bulk turnover time calculated from overall respiration and carbon stocks (a one-pool approach) at elevated CO2, without a change in decomposition rate constants of individual pools (i.e., without priming). Therefore, the priming effect cannot be quantified using a one-pool model alone, and even a two-pool model may be inadequate, depending on the effect size as well as the distribution of soil organic carbon and turnover times. In addition to standard measurements of carbon stocks and CO2 fluxes, we argue that quantifying the fate of new plant inputs requires isotopic tracers and microbial measurements. Our results offer insights into modeling and interpreting priming from observations.},

abstract = {Whenever Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to assess the climate impact of buildings, those with high content of biobased materials result with the lowest impact. Traditional approaches to LCA fail to capture aspects such as biogenic carbon exchanges, their timing and the effects from carbon storage. This paper explores a prospective increase of biobased materials in Swedish buildings, using traditional and dynamic LCA to assess the climate impact effects of this increase. Three alternative designs are analysed; one without biobased material content, a CLT building and an alternative timber design with “increased bio”. Different scenario setups explore the sensitivity to key assumptions such as the building's service life, end-of-life scenario, setting of forest sequestration before (growth) or after (regrowth) harvesting and time horizon of the dynamic LCA. Results show that increasing the biobased material content in a building reduces its climate impact when biogenic sequestration and emissions are accounted for using traditional or dynamic LCA in all the scenarios explored. The extent of these reductions is significantly sensitive to the end-of-life scenario assumed, the timing of the forest growth or regrowth and the time horizon of the integrated global warming impact in a dynamic LCA. A time horizon longer than one hundred years is necessary if biogenic flows from forest carbon sequestration and the building's life cycle are accounted for. Further climate impact reductions can be obtained by keeping the biogenic carbon dioxide stored after end-of-life or by extending the building's service life, but the time horizon and impact allocation among different life cycles must be properly addressed.},

A slight linear decrease between the root mass: length distribution ratio and the soil depth was found for monocotyledons while an exponential decrease with depth was found for dicotyledons. These results indicated that roots were thicker at upper soil layers with the effect much larger for dicotyledons. The estimated depth at which 50% of total root was accumulated for different crops varied from 8 cm to 20 cm. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) showed the deepest rooting profile with a fitted maximum rooting depth (dmax) of 177 cm but another perennial, fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.), had the shallowest dmax of 78 cm. In general, cereal and pulse crop roots were distributed more evenly in soil profile while more roots were accumulated in the upper soil layers for oilseed crops. The estimated root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroecosystem models for good representations of belowground processes and enhance the accuracy of carbon and water cycling estimation in agroecosystem.},

Five cultivars were grown under irrigated (control) and rainfall (stressed) conditions. Different agro-physiological and biochemical parameters were studied: electrolyte leakage, relative water content, chlorophyll fluorescence, proline, soluble sugars, specific peroxidase activity, yield and drought stress indices. It was revealed that a water deficit increased proline content, electrolyte leakage, soluble sugars and specific peroxidase activity and decreased relative water content, fluorescence and grain yield. According to these parameters and drought stress indices, our investigation indicated that old cultivars are the best-adapted to local conditions and showed characteristics of drought tolerance, while recent cultivars showed more drought susceptibility. Therefore, local cultivars of each country should be kept by farmers and plant breeders to preserve their genetic heritage.},

abstract = {To face future challenges in crop production dictated by global climate changes, breeders and plant researchers collaborate to develop productive crops that are able to withstand a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, crop selection is often focused on shoot performance alone, as observation of root properties is more complex and asks for artificial and extensive phenotyping platforms. In addition, most root research focuses on development, while a direct link to the functionality of plasticity in root development for tolerance is often lacking. In this paper we review the currently known root system architecture (RSA) responses in Arabidopsis and a number of crop species to a range of abiotic stresses, including nutrient limitation, drought, salinity, flooding and extreme temperatures. For each of these stresses, the key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the RSA response are highlighted. To explore the relevance for crop selection, we especially review and discuss studies linking root architectural responses to stress tolerance. This will provide a first step towards understanding the relevance of adaptive root development for a plant's response to its environment. We suggest that functional evidence on the role of root plasticity will support breeders in their efforts to include root properties in their current selection pipeline for abiotic stress tolerance, aimed to improve the robustness of crops.},

abstract = {Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a critical regulator of soil organic matter dynamics and terrestrial carbon fluxes, with strong implications for soil biogeochemistry models. While ecologists increasingly appreciate the importance of CUE, its core concepts remain ambiguous: terminology is inconsistent and confusing, methods capture variable temporal and spatial scales, and the significance of many fundamental drivers remains inconclusive. Here we outline the processes underlying microbial efficiency and propose a conceptual framework that structures the definition of CUE according to increasingly broad temporal and spatial drivers where (1) CUEP reflects population-scale carbon use efficiency of microbes governed by species-specific metabolic and thermodynamic constraints, (2) CUEC defines community-scale microbial efficiency as gross biomass production per unit substrate taken up over short time scales, largely excluding recycling of microbial necromass and exudates, and (3) CUEE reflects the ecosystem-scale efficiency of net microbial biomass production (growth) per unit substrate taken up as iterative breakdown and recycling of microbial products occurs. CUEE integrates all internal and extracellular constraints on CUE and hence embodies an ecosystem perspective that fully captures all drivers of microbial biomass synthesis and decay. These three definitions are distinct yet complementary, capturing the capacity for carbon storage in microbial biomass across different ecological scales. By unifying the existing concepts and terminology underlying microbial efficiency, our framework enhances data interpretation and theoretical advances.},

abstract = {White-tailed deer were introduced into the Czech Republic about one hundred years ago. Population numbers have remained stable at low density despite almost no harvesting. This differs from other introductions of this species in Europe. We presumed that one of the possible factors preventing expansion of the white-tailed deer Population is lack of high-quality food components in in area overpopulated by sympatric roe, fallow and red deer. We analyzed the WTD winter diet and diets of the other deer species to get information on their feeding strategy (hiring a critical period of a year. We focused primarily on conifer needle consumption, a generally accepted indicator of starvation and on bramble leaves as an indicator of high-quality items. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) If the environment has a limited food supply, the poorest competitors of the four deer species will have the highest proportion of conifer needles in the diet : (2) the deer will overlap in trophic niches and will share limited nutritious resource (bramble). White-tailed, roe. fallow. and red deer diets were investigated by microscopic analysis of plant remain,,,, in their faeces. The volume of bramble decreased in the diet of all four deer species from November to March. The content of conifer needles in the diet of white-tailed and roe deer was negatively correlated with bramble and in spring made up 90 % of their diet volume. On the other hand conifer needles in the diet of red and fallow deer occurred only in January with snow cover. Fallow and red deer started the compensation of winter starvation at least one month earlier than both roe and white-tailed deer. A high content of conifers in white-tailed deer diet in the second half of the winter fully support the presumption about low nutritional food supply and its diet. It can lead to a markedly impaired condition for white-tailed and roe deer and negatively affect their condition. The dietary overlap of four sympatric deer species was extensive in winter. All species share a limited good quality food supply (bramble) when food is scarce, suggesting that interspecific competition may occur.},

abstract = {Our study tests the emerging paradigm that biochemical recalcitrance does not affect substantially long-term (50 years) SOC persistence. We analyzed the molecular composition of SOC in archived soils originating from four European long-term bare fallow experiments (Askov, Rothamsted, Versailles and Ultuna). The soils had been collected after various periods (up to 53 years) under bare fallow. With increasing duration of bare fallow without new organic inputs, the relative abundance of cutin- and suberin-derived compounds declined substantially, and the abundance of lignin-derived compounds was close to zero. Conversely, the relative abundance of plant-derived long-chain alkanes remained almost constant or increased during the bare fallow period. The relative abundance of N-containing compounds, considered to be abundant in SOC derived from microbial activity, increased consistently illustrating that microbial turnover of SOC continues even when plant inputs are stopped. The persistence of the different families of plant-derived compounds differed markedly over the scale of half a century, which may be ascribed to their contrasting chemical characteristics and recalcitrance, or to differences in their interactions with the soil mineral matrix, and likely some combination since chemical composition drives the degree of mineral association. Using soil from this unique set of long-term bare fallow experiments, we provide direct evidence that multi-decadal scale persistent SOC is enriched in microbe-derived compounds but also includes a substantial fraction of plant-derived compounds.},

abstract = {Fire is one of the most important natural disturbances in the boreal forest. It strongly influences boreal forest structure and function, and alters microbial biomass and species composition e.g. by significantly reducing the abundance of decomposing fungi. We measured carbon stocks and estimated fungal biomass and soil carbon turnover in Pinus sylvestris stands on a fire chronosequence from 2 to 152years post-fire. Results show that the turnover time of soil carbon was longest in the area where fire occurred 2years ago (117years) and approximately two times shorter (ca. 60years) in the areas where fire occurred 42, 60 and 152years ago. The soil carbon turnover time in our study areas was associated with very slow fungal biomass recovery. The fungal biomass (ergosterol content), soil carbon content and soil CO2 efflux reached the same levels as in the oldest site approximately 60years after the fire. Our results indicate that the slow multi-decadal post-fire recovery of fungal biomass drives the soil carbon balance of boreal forests, and disturbances such as fires have a profound influence on soil carbon turnover for decades. On the other hand, the longer post-fire residence time of carbon in the soil compared to older forests suggests that fire effects on the soil carbon pool in boreal forests might be less dramatic than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Production of native and hybridized varieties of Populus has received considerable interest in temperate regions as an alternative to agricultural crops and an additional wood source, while acting as a potential carbon (C) sink to offset emissions of fossil fuel-based greenhouse gases. Research of root system dynamics in Populus species is expanding, however, our understanding of the nature and role of fine roots (FR) is incomplete. The study objective, therefore, was to review the literature regarding FR production, mortality and longevity in Populus, and evaluate the magnitude and significance of the FR fraction to C sequestration. FRs, conventionally defined as less than 2 mm in diameter and responsible for water and nutrient uptake, are an essential component of the tree. Populus FRs are relatively short-lived, with reported lifespans ranging from 30 to 300 days, depending on root diameter, tree species and age, and soil environmental factors. Standing FR biomass fluctuates throughout the growing season. Fine root production generally peaks in mid-summer, and ranges between 1.0 and 5.0 mg ha-1 yr-1, while FR mortality has less seasonal amplitude. Production and mortality dynamics in Populus are highly plastic in response to soil environmental conditions, and although opposing conclusions have been proposed, research suggests soil moisture and nitrogen to be most important. Results from the literature indicate annual FR turnover to the soil C pool may be small (0.2-1.6 mg C ha-1 yr-1), but substantial in maintaining or enhancing C levels in natural and managed stands of Populus. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

Increase in annual mean temperature was 0.49°C during the period, commencing from 1901 to 2003. In terms of increase in temperature, the West Coast of India is warmer, followed by the Northeast India and the Western Himalayas when compared to other regions of the country. The years 2009 and 2010 were recorded as the warmest in the country since 1901. Increase in temperature and rainfall was noticed in the country in tune with the global warming and climate change though spatial and seasonal differences were evident. At the same time, rainfall during the monsoon season was deficit in recent years like 1987, 2002 and 2009 which adversely affected the food grains production in India. In the case of thermo-sensitive crops like tea, coffee, cardamom, cocoa, cashew and black pepper, the projected increase of 2-3°C in temperature may directly affect the cropped area and productivity. The observations on mango and cashew flowering also indicated that increase in night temperature during winter is a concern as seen in 2010. The coconut productivity in Kerala is likely to decline under the projected climate change scenario as the occurrence of floods and summer droughts is likely to affect the crop adversely, and their frequency is likely to increase under the projected climate change scenario. Therefore, proactive technologies need to be developed against the global warming and climate change for sustenance of crop production in horticulture as a part of climate resilient horticulture.},

Climate was shown to be an important factor of carbon uptake by ecosystems: by varying the growing season length (a 22-d longer season in 2005 than in 2007 increased carbon sink by 13%) or by the effect of short- term synoptic situations (e.g. summer hot and dry days reduced net carbon storage by 58% relative to hot and wet days).

abstract = {Large tracts of arctic and subarctic peatlands are underlain by permafrost. These peatlands store large quantities of carbon (C), and are currently under severe threat from climate change. The aim of this study was to determine the size and organic chemistry of the easily degradable C pool in permafrost peatlands and link the functional organic chemistry to temperature and moisture controls of greenhouse gas emissions. First, we used a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments to assess the influence of increased temperature and flooding on CO2and CH4emissions from sixteen permafrost peatlands in subarctic Sweden and Canada. Second, we determined the variation in organic matter chemistry and the associated microbial community composition of the peat active layer, with depth using quantitative13C solid-state NMR and molecular biomarkers respectively. We demonstrate that the peat organic chemistry strongly controls CO2release from peat and that ca. 35 and 26% of the peat organic matter, at the Swedish and Canadian peatlands sites, respectively, is easily degradable by heterotrophic microorganisms. In contrast to CO2, CH4emissions were decoupled from peat functional organic chemistry. We show a strong relationship between the microbial community structure and the peat organic chemistry suggesting that substrate type and abundance is an important driver of microbial composition in sub-arctic peatlands. Despite considerable variation in peat chemistry and microbial community composition with depth the temperature sensitivity was comparable throughout the active layer. Our study shows that functional organic chemistry controls both soil respiration rates and the composition of the microbial community. Furthermore, if these peatlands collapse and flood on thawing, they are unlikely to become large emitters of CH4without additional input of labile substrates.},

abstract = {An understanding of the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) is important for our ability to develop management practices that preserve soil quality and sequester carbon. Most SOM decomposition models represent the heterogeneity of organic matter by a few discrete compartments with different turnover rates, while other models employ a continuous quality distribution. To make the multi-compartment models more mechanistic in nature, it has been argued that the compartments should be related to soil fractions actually occurring and having a functional role in the soil. In this paper, we make the case that fractionation methods that can measure continuous quality distributions should be developed, and that the temporal development of these distributions should be incorporated into SOM models. The measured continuous SOM quality distributions should hold valuable information not only for model development, but also for direct interpretation. Measuring continuous distributions requires that the measurements along the quality variable are so frequent that the distribution approaches the underlying continuum. Continuous distributions lead to possible simplifications of the model formulations, which considerably reduce the number of parameters needed to describe SOM turnover. A general framework for SOM models representing SOM across measurable quality distributions is presented and simplifications for specific situations are discussed. Finally, methods that have been used or have the potential to be used to measure continuous quality SOM distributions are reviewed. Generally, existing fractionation methods will have to be modified to allow measurement of distributions or new fractionation techniques will have to be developed. Developing the distributional models in concert with the fractionation methods to measure the distributions will be a major task. We hope the current paper will help generate the interest needed to accommodate this.},

Outliers in time series, depending on their nature, may have a moderate to significant impact on the effectiveness of the standard methodology for time series analysis with respect to model identification, estimation, and forecasting. In this article we use an iterative outlier detection and adjustment procedure to obtain joint estimates of model parameters and outlier effects. Four types of outliers are considered, and the issues of spurious and masking effects are discussed. The major differences between this procedure and those proposed in earlier literature include (a) the types and effects of outliers are obtained based on less contaminated estimates of model parameters, (b) the outlier effects are estimated simultaneously using multiple regression, and (c) the model parameters and the outlier effects are estimated jointly. The sampling behavior of the test statistics for cases of small to large sample sizes is investigated through a simulation study. The performance of the procedure is examined over a representative set of outlier cases. We find that the proposed procedure performs well in terms of detecting outliers and obtaining unbiased parameter estimates. An example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure. It is demonstrated that this procedure performs effectively in avoiding spurious outliers and masking effects.

abstract = {The availability of nitrogen (N) is a critical control on the cycling and storage of soil carbon (C). Yet there are conflicting conceptual models to explain how N availability influences decomposition of organic matter by soil microbial communities. Several lines of evidence suggest that N availability limits decomposition: the earliest stages of leaf litter decay are associated with a net import of N from the soil environment, and both observations and models show that high-N organic matter decomposes more rapidly. In direct contrast to these findings, experimental additions of inorganic N to soils broadly show a suppression of microbial activity, which is inconsistent with N limitation of decomposition. Resolving this apparent contradiction is critical to representing nutrient dynamics in predictive ecosystem models under a multitude of global change factors that alter soil N availability. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework, the Carbon, Acidity and Mineral Protection (CAMP) hypothesis, to understand the effects of N availability on soil C cycling and storage, and explore the predictions of this framework with a mathematical model. Our model simulations demonstrate that N addition can have opposing effects on separate soil C pools (particulate and mineral-protected carbon), because they are differentially affected by microbial biomass growth. Moreover, changes in N availability are frequently linked to shifts in soil pH or osmotic stress, which can independently affect microbial biomass dynamics and mask N stimulation of microbial activity. Thus, the net effect of N addition on soil C is dependent upon interactions among microbial physiology, soil mineralogy, and soil acidity. We believe our synthesis provides a broadly applicable conceptual framework to understand and predict the effect of changes in soil N availability on ecosystem C cycling under global change.},

abstract = {Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide worldwide. It is a broad spectrum herbicide and its agricultural uses increased considerably after the development of glyphosate-resistant genetically modified (GM) varieties. Since glyphosate was introduced in 1974, all regulatory assessments have established that glyphosate has low hazard potential to mammals, however, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in March 2015 that it is probably carcinogenic. The IARC conclusion was not confirmed by the EU assessment or the recent joint WHO/FAO evaluation, both using additional evidence. Glyphosate is not the first topic of disagreement between IARC and regulatory evaluations, but has received greater attention. This review presents the scientific basis of the glyphosate health assessment conducted within the European Union (EU) renewal process, and explains the differences in the carcinogenicity assessment with IARC. Use of different data sets, particularly on long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity in rodents, could partially explain the divergent views; but methodological differences in the evaluation of the available evidence have been identified. The EU assessment did not identify a carcinogenicity hazard, revised the toxicological profile proposing new toxicological reference values, and conducted a risk assessment for some representatives uses. Two complementary exposure assessments, human-biomonitoring and food-residues-monitoring, suggests that actual exposure levels are below these reference values and do not represent a public concern.},

abstract = {Disturbance to wildlife from human recreational activities is increasing as remote areas become accessible to greater numbers of people. We used Global Positioning System tracking collars to monitor the movements of red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) stags ( n = 8) in a herd whose feeding grounds lie close to a popular walking track in the Highlands of Scotland. The track is used by around 20,000 walkers per year and is busiest in summer and at weekends. In a 2-year study, the locations of collared deer were recorded at 2-h intervals on typically busy days (Sundays: mean number of walkers = 204) and quiet days (Wednesdays: mean number of walkers = 49) during May and June. The deer were consistently further from the track on Sundays than Wednesdays (371 vs 286 m) and moved greater distances between fixes (365 vs 308 m). The amount of time spent (percentage of total fixes) in the small area of grassland closest to the track was lower on Sundays than Wednesdays (6% vs 13%). Although 97% of walkers use the track during the day (between 0800 and 2000 h), there was no evidence of compensatory use of grassland at night, when the deer moved to higher ground dominated by heather moorland. The results demonstrate that animals which appear to be habituated to regular disturbance within their home territory may nevertheless alter their behaviour and potentially diet composition, as a result of that disturbance.},

PyC had been considered to be slowly released but new results challenged this assumption, indicating that PyC can be lost within decades. We analyzed total soil organic carbon and PyC content (detectable as benzene polycarboxylic acids) in bulk samples, light and heavy fractions from a 55 year old bare fallow and a nearby steppe soil. Loss of PyC stock due to the long-term fallow management was much smaller (6%) than for soil organic carbon (33%), and we detected no changes in the degree of aromatic condensation of PyC. Most (70%) of the PyC was associated with the heavy fraction, and less with the light fraction (30%) pointing to organo-mineral interactions as important stabilizing processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lasota2018,
abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the study was to estimate how the deadwood of different tree species in various stages of decomposition affected nutrient dynamics. Materials and methods: The deadwood of eight species (common alder, common aspen, common ash, silver fir, pedunculate oak, Norway spruce, common hornbeam and silver birch) was selected. Three logs from each species in the third, fourth and fifth decay classes were chosen for analysis. Wood in the third decay class was characterised by larger hard fragments, fragmented bark and no branches; in the fourth decay class, it was characterised by small pieces and a fragmented bark; and in the fifth decay class, it was characterised by a soft texture and no bark. The investigation was carried out in the Czarna R{\'{o}}zga Reserve in Central Poland. Tension lysimeters were installed under each log in the humus horizon. The water samples collected from tension lysimeters were chemically analysed in the laboratory. The water chemistry was analysed by means of ion chromatography using a DIONEX ICS 5000 unit. Results and discussion: The leachate obtained from different tree species contained different ion concentrations. The high similarity of the concentration of total anions and statistically significant differences in the content of total cations were determined in the leachate from the wood of coniferous and deciduous species. The concentration of the cations increases with the advancement of the decomposition level. A general linear model analysis demonstrates that wood species and the decomposition classes are of equal importance in defining the ion composition of the filtrate leaching from deadwood. Conclusions: Wood at the highest decomposition stage releases more ions to the surface soil layers than wood at the lower decay class. An exception from the rule is the wood of birch, which in the III decay class releases more ions than in its higher decay classes. When comparing the ionic composition of leachate released from wood of coniferous and deciduous tree species, the latter are characterised by higher cation concentrations in comparison with coniferous species. Among the deciduous species, wood of such species as ash, hornbeam, aspen, birch and alder has the most favourable effects on the soil surface horizons through its supply with ionic substances. The ash wood releases high amounts of calcium, hornbeam wood releases magnesium and sodium, and aspen releases calcium, potassium and nitrate anion. From the analysed coniferous species, fir wood has a more favourable effect in terms of ion release to soil than spruce wood.},

Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST), the Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3), and the Japanese Meteorological Agency's Centennial Observation-Based Estimates of SSTs (COBE-SST) from 2003 to the present. The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07° to 0.12°C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets.},

The drivers of SOC evolution identified using Random Forest analysis were consistent with those considered in AMG. The model with its default parameterization simulated accurately the changes in SOC stocks over time, the relative model error (RRMSE = 5.3%)being comparable to the measurement error (CV = 4.3%). Model performance was little affected by the choice of plant C input estimation method, but was improved by a site specific optimization of SOC pool partitioning. AMG shows a good potential for predicting SOC evolution in scenarios varying in climate, soil properties and crop management.},

All diets were contaminated with pesticides (1-6 out of 262 measured), heavy metals (2-3 out of 4, mostly lead and cadmium), PCDD/Fs (1-13 out of 17) and PCBs (5-15 out of 18). Out of 22 GMOs tested for, Roundup-tolerant GMOs were the most frequently detected, constituting up to 48% of the diet. The main pesticide detected was Roundup, with residues of glyphosate and AMPA in 9 of the 13 diets, up to 370 ppb. The levels correlated with the amount of Roundup-tolerant GMOs. Toxic effects of these pollutants on liver, neurodevelopment, and reproduction are documented. The sum of the hazard quotients of the pollutants in the diets (an estimator of risk with a threshold of 1) varied from 15.8 to 40.5. Thus the chronic consumption of these diets can be considered at risk. Efforts toward safer diets will improve the reliability of toxicity tests in biomedical research and regulatory toxicology.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest to combine adaptation and mitigation measures that provide win-win solutions to climate change. Agroforestry systems offer compelling synergies between adaptation and mitigation. This article reviews the empirical evidence from various studies on how trees and agroforestry systems enhance smallholders' capacity to adapt to climate risks. Agroforestry systems improve resilience of smallholder farmers through more efficient water utilization, improved microclimate, enhanced soil productivity and nutrient cycling, control of pests and diseases, improved farm productivity, and diversified and increased farm income while at the same time sequestering carbon. Although these seems very promising, tradeoffs may arise both at the farm and landscape scales.},

abstract = {Swedish agricultural land comprises about 3 Mha and its topsoil contains about 270 Mt C (0-25 cm depth). Based on daily climate data, annual yield data and a soil database, we calculate the topsoil C dynamics for Swedish agricultural land 1990-2004, using a soil C balance model, ICBM. Losses from high C (organic) soils are calculated from subsidence, which in turn is calculated from soil properties, cropping system and weather conditions. We also present scenarios and projections into the future. Mineral soils are close to balance in all of the eight agricultural regions investigated. Average soil C mass roughly increases from South to North, since the lower yields and thus C inputs in Northern regions are more than balanced by the higher decomposition rates due to warmer climate in the South. The higher proportion of grass leys in the North also contributes to higher C mass. High C soils (> 7{%} C, corresponding to 12{%} soil organic matter content) lose 2-6 t C ha(-1) year(-1), depending on weather and cropping system, and total annual loss from Swedish agricultural high-C soils is about 1 Mt year(-1). This loss is discussed in the context of plant production and remedial actions. Projections into the future, assuming that a temperature increase leading to increased decomposition rates also will lead to higher yields, indicate a potential to at least maintain soil C mass in Swedish agricultural mineral soils. Growing crops with residues more resistant towards decomposition would be an efficient way to increase soil C mass. See also http://www-mv.slu.se/vaxtnaring/olle.},

abstract = {Different tree species influence litter decomposition directly through species-specific litter traits, and indirectly through distinct modifications of the local decomposition environment. Whether these indirect effects on decomposition are influenced by tree species diversity is presently not clear. We addressed this question by studying the decomposition of two common substrates, cellulose paper and wood sticks, in a total of 209 forest stands of varying tree species diversity across six major forest types at the scale of Europe. Tree species richness showed a weak but positive correlation with the decomposition of cellulose but not with that of wood. Surprisingly, macroclimate had only a minor effect on cellulose decomposition and no effect on wood decomposition despite the wide range in climatic conditions among sites from Mediterranean to boreal forests. Instead, forest canopy density and stand-specific litter traits affected the decomposition of both substrates, with a particularly clear negative effect of the proportion of evergreen tree litter. Our study suggests that species richness and composition of tree canopies modify decomposition indirectly through changes in microenvironmental conditions. These canopy-induced differences in the local decomposition environment control decomposition to a greater extent than continental-scale differences in macroclimatic conditions.},

abstract = {Stocks of soil organic carbon represent a large component of the carbon\ncycle that may participate in climate change feedbacks, particularly on\ndecadal and centennial timescales. For Earth system models (ESMs), the\nability to accurately represent the global distribution of existing soil\ncarbon stocks is a prerequisite for accurately predicting future\ncarbon-climate feedbacks. We compared soil carbon simulations from 11\nmodel centers to empirical data from the Harmonized World Soil Database\n(HWSD) and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD). Model\nestimates of global soil carbon stocks ranged from 510 to 3040 Pg C,\ncompared to an estimate of 1260 Pg C (with a 95% confidence interval of\n890-1660 Pg C) from the HWSD. Model simulations for the high northern\nlatitudes fell between 60 and 820 Pg C, compared to 500 Pg C (with a\n95% confidence interval of 380-620 Pg C) for the NCSCD and 290 PgC for\nthe HWSD. Global soil carbon varied 5.9 fold across models in response\nto a 2.6-fold variation in global net primary productivity (NPP) and a\n3.6-fold variation in global soil carbon turnover times. Model-data\nagreement was moderate at the biome level (R-2 values ranged from 0.38\nto 0.97 with a mean of 0.75); however, the spatial distribution of soil\ncarbon simulated by the ESMs at the 1 degrees scale was not well\ncorrelated with the HWSD (Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.4\nand root mean square errors from 9.4 to 20.8 kg C m(-2)). In northern\nlatitudes where the two data sets overlapped, agreement between the HWSD\nand the NCSCD was poor (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.33),\nindicating uncertainty in empirical estimates of soil carbon. We found\nthat a reduced complexity model dependent on NPP and soil temperature\nexplained much of the 1 degrees spatial variation in soil carbon within\nmost ESMs (R-2 values between 0.62 and 0.93 for 9 of 11 model centers).\nHowever, the same reduced complexity model only explained 10% of the\nspatial variation in HWSD soil carbon when driven by observations of NPP\nand temperature, implying that other drivers or processes may be more\nimportant in explaining observed soil carbon distributions. The reduced\ncomplexity model also showed that differences in simulated soil carbon\nacross ESMs were driven by differences in simulated NPP and the\nparameterization of soil heterotrophic respiration (inter-model R-2 =\n0.93), not by structural differences between the models. Overall, our\nresults suggest that despite fair global-scale agreement with\nobservational data and moderate agreement at the biome scale, most ESMs\ncannot reproduce grid-scale variation in soil carbon and may be missing\nkey processes. Future work should focus on improving the simulation of\ndriving variables for soil carbon stocks and modifying model structures\nto include additional processes.},

abstract = {The soil microbial community plays a critical part in tropical ecosystem functioning through its role in the soil organic matter (SOM) cycle. This study evaluates the relative effects of soil type and land use on (i) soil microbial community structure and (ii) the contribution of SOM derived from the original forest vegetation to the functioning of pasture and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) ecosystems. We used principal components analysis (PCA) of soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles to evaluate microbial community structure and PLFA stable carbon isotope ratios (delta13C) as indicators of the delta13C of microbial substrates. Soil type mainly determined the relative proportions of gram positive versus gram negative bacteria whereas land use primarily determined the relative proportion of fungi, protozoa, and actinomycetes versus other types of microorganisms. Comparison of a simple model to our PLFA delta13C data from land use chronosequences indicates that forest-derived SOM is actively cycled for appreciably longer times in sugarcane ecosystems developed on Andisols (mean turnover time = 50 yr) than in sugarcane ecosystems developed on an Oxisol (mean turnover time = 13 yr). Our analyses indicate that soil chronosequence PLFA delta13C measurements can be useful indicators of the contribution that SOM derived from the original vegetation makes to continued ecosystem function under the new land use.},

abstract = {As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on >2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P < 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500-1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.},

abstract = {Large scale environmental monitoring schemes would benefit from accurate information on the composition of soil organic matter (SOM), but so far routine procedures for describing SOM composition remain a chimera. Here, we present the initial assessment of a two step strategy for expeditious determination of SOM composition that involves: (i) building infrared fingerprints from near and mid infrared spectroscopies, two rapid and cheap yet reliable technologies; and (ii) calibrating such infrared fingerprints with multivariate chemometrics from a molecular mixing model based on the more expensive and time consuming13C nuclear magnetic resonance technique, which discriminates five biochemical components: carbohydrate, protein, lignin, lipid and black carbon. We show fair to excellent predictive ability of the calibrated infrared fingerprints for four out of these five biochemical components, with cross-validated ratios of performance to inter-quartile distance from 3.2 to 8.3, on a small set of 23 soil samples with a wide range of organic carbon content (12-500g/kg). Multivariate calibration models were highly selective (<2% of infrared data were used for all models). However, the specificity to one particular biochemical component of the infrared wavebands automatically selected by each model was relatively low, except for lipid. Achieving direct predictions of SOM composition on unknown soil samples with infrared spectroscopy alone will require further independent validation and a larger number of samples. Overall, the implementation of our strategy at a broader scale, based on available13C nuclear magnetic resonance soil libraries, could provide a cost effective solution for the routine assessment of SOM composition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Drainage and land-use are key factors that trigger CO2emissions from cultivated organic soils. Drainage enhances aeration, and land-use might affect peat decomposition due to the input of fresh organic matter (FOM). The effect of FOM addition on peat decomposition of agriculturally used organic soils has seldom been quantified experimentally. In this study, we i) incubated soil samples taken from three adjacent former peatland sites that were drained and managed as cropland, perennial grassland and forest, respectively, and measured CO2release over 16 months at 20 °C. In a second experiment, ii) we incubated soil samples from the same three sites with and without adding corn straw as FOM (2% w/w) at 20 °C over three weeks. The13C and14C signatures of soil organic carbon (SOC) and emitted CO2enabled us to apportion the amount of decomposed corn, as well as to estimate relative effects of corn addition on the decomposition of SOC from old peat (SOCold) and from young soil organic carbon (SOCyoung). In the first experiment, samples lost between 0.03 and 0.09 mg CO2-C mg SOC− 1in the order forest > grassland > cropland. The higher14C values of the emitted CO2vs. that of SOC indicated that SOCyoungwas more easily decomposable. FOM addition induced negative (− 14.8 ± 5.2%), positive (+ 14.9 ± 4.6%) and neutral priming (− 14.2 ± 30.0%) of SOC decomposition in the forest, grassland and cropland samples, respectively. Most importantly, we find that the relative contribution of SOColdto the overall CO2release consistently decreased after FOM application, whereas decomposition of SOCyoungwas rather stimulated. The latter finding is in line with previous studies on intact peat. Our results show that young and old C pools in managed organic soils respond differently to the addition of fresh plant residues, and FOM addition can effectively reduce the decomposition of old peat. Hitherto negative priming was never reported for agriculturally used organic soils and it might be caused by the overall poor decomposability of old peat.},

abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils--including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost--than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

abstract = {The health effects of a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize (from 11% in the diet), cultivated with or without Roundup, and Roundup alone (from 0.1. ppb in water), were studied 2. years in rats. In females, all treated groups died 2-3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls, the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by GMO and Roundup treatments. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5-5.5 times higher. This pathology was confirmed by optic and transmission electron microscopy. Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3-2.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600. days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76% of the altered parameters were kidney related. These results can be explained by the non linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, but also by the overexpression of the transgene in the GMO and its metabolic consequences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information about root distribution is important for characterization and modeling of water and nutrient uptake, biomass, and yield. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of roots in row crops, the reliability and representativeness of estimates of RL and root morphology using core sampling depend on the number of samples and their location. The objectives of this study were to evaluate errors when assessing RLD and root morphology from auger core sampling schemes, to estimate 2D distributions of RLD by auger core sampling, and to assess the number of samples necessary for representative estimates of RLD and RD classes. The reference dataset utilized in this study is based on completely sampled 3D soil monoliths under maize, taken at three different dates (55, 78, and 104 days after planting) and two different row spacings (75 and 37.5 cm). A hypothetical auger core sampling scheme with one core within the row and another midway between rows mostly overpredicted total RLD. Bias was lower when using an 1:3 weighting scheme. Estimation of 2D vertical RLD distribution by calculating the ratio of RLD in the plant row to RLD midway between rows yielded reasonable estimates only when the average of eight cores was used. An assessment of the proportions of RD classes yielded high bias values, even when using the average of eight cores. An analysis of sampling errors using successively more cores revealed that for total RLD, to attain a bias <20%, more than ten samples would be necessary. This suggests that the number of core samples taken in many root studies could be too low. This bias was even higher when taking core samples for estimation of proportions of RD classes, where a reasonably low bias between estimated and “true” values could not be attained in this study even with ten core samples. Consequently, when taking samples for measurement of root morphological parameters, more detailed and site-adapted sampling schemes have to be devised. For estimating total averaged RLD, two core samples (within-row and midway between rows) could be sufficient when using a 1:3 weighting scheme for calculating the average RLD. When samples are taken in a more random manner and no weighting is applied, the necessary number of samples would be at least ten.},

abstract = {Fungi typically live in highly diverse communities composed of multiple ecological guilds. Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e., saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds, another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new categories and records as well as refine those already in existence.},

abstract = {Bioenergy from forest residues can be used to avoid fossil carbon emissions, but removing biomass from forests reduces carbon stock sizes and carbon input to litter and soil. The magnitude and longevity of these carbon stock changes determine how effective measures to utilize bioenergy from forest residues are to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector and to mitigate climate change. In this study, we estimate the variability of GHG emissions and consequent climate impacts resulting from producing bioenergy from stumps, branches and residual biomass of forest thinning operations in Finland, and the contribution of the variability in key factors, i.e. forest residue diameter, tree species, geographical location of the forest biomass removal site and harvesting method, to the emissions and their climate impact. The GHG emissions and the consequent climate impacts estimated as changes in radiative forcing were comparable to fossil fuels when bioenergy production from forest residues was initiated. The emissions and climate impacts decreased over time because forest residues were predicted to decompose releasing CO2 even if left in the forest. Both were mainly affected by forest residue diameter and climatic conditions of the forest residue collection site. Tree species and the harvest method of thinning wood (whole tree or stem-only) had a smaller effect on the magnitude of emissions. The largest reduction in the energy production climate impacts after 20 years, up to 62%, was achieved when coal was replaced by the branches collected from Southern Finland, whereas the smallest reduction 7% was gained by using stumps from Northern Finland instead of natural gas. After 100 years the corresponding values were 77% and 21%. The choice of forest residue biomass collected affects significantly the emissions and climate impacts of forest bioenergy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7 years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (Reco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (±SD) −104 ± 80 g CO2-C m−2 yr−1(i.e. CO2sink) and 9 ± 2 g CH4-C m−2 yr−1(i.e. CH4source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.},

Increasing disturbances could strongly impact the forest carbon budget3,4 , and are suggested to contribute to the recently observed carbon sink saturation in Europe's forests5 . Here we show that forest disturbance damage in Europe has continued to increase in the first decade of the twenty-first century.

abstract = {We review the consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services from the industrial-scale extraction of logging residues (tops, branches and stumps from harvested trees and small-diameter trees from thinnings) in managed forests. Logging residue extraction can replace fossil fuels, and thus contribute to climate change mitigation. The additional biomass and nutrients removed, and soils and other structures disturbed, have several potential environmental impacts. To evaluate potential impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity we reviewed 279 scientific papers that compared logging residue extraction with non-extraction, the majority of which were conducted in Northern Europe and North America. The weight of available evidence indicates that logging residue extraction can have significant negative effects on biodiversity, especially for species naturally adapted to sun-exposed conditions and the large amounts of dead wood that are created by large-scaled forest disturbances. Slash extraction may also pose risks for future biomass production itself, due to the associated loss of nutrients. For water quality, reindeer herding, mammalian game species, berries, and natural heritage the results were complicated by primarily negative but some positive effects, while for recreation and pest control positive effects were more consistent. Further, there are initial negative effects on carbon storage, but these effects are transient and carbon stocks are mostly restored over decadal time perspectives. We summarize ways of decreasing some of the negative effects of logging residue extraction on specific ecosystem services, by changing the categories of residue extracted, and site or forest type targeted for extraction. However, we found that suggested pathways for minimizing adverse outcomes were often in conflict among the ecosystem services assessed. Compensatory measures for logging residue extraction may also be used (e.g. ash recycling, liming, fertilization), though these may also be associated with adverse environmental impacts.},

The rate of accumulation of soil organic matter is often higher on fertilized fields, but this carries a carbon 'cost' that is seldom assessed in the form of CO2 emissions during the production and application of inorganic fertilizer. Irrigation of semiarid lands may also produce a sink for carbon in plant biomass, but its contribution to a sink for carbon in soils must be discounted by CO2 that is emitted when energy is used to pump irrigation water and when CaCO3 precipitates in the soil profile.

abstract = {We investigated the merits of radiocarbon measurements for estimating soil organic matter (SOM) turnover and vertical transport for a temperate deciduous forest in Germany. Eleven parameters, defining decomposition and transport in the soil carbon model SOMPROF, were estimated using a Bayesian approach based on organic carbon measurements and radiocarbon concentration of SOM and heterotrophic respiration. The addition of radiocarbon data had strong effects on the parameters, most importantly a reduction of the decomposition and production rate of the slowest SOM pool by an order of magnitude, and a similar reduction in advective SOM transport. The modified parameters further led to changes in the partitioning of SOM over the different model pools. The calibration results were subsequently used to perform transient soil carbon projections for the period 1901–2100. These simulations were run with parameter sets from calibrations both with and without radiocarbon. The results show an increase over time of topsoil carbon and a decrease in the subsoil, adding to a net gain overall. Near the end of the 21st century, total carbon stocks stabilize and—for the radiocarbon-constrained model—start to decrease. However, the changes are small compared to the total stocks. The model results for the calibrations with and without radiocarbon are in general quite similar, but the latter shows notably higher heterotrophic respiration fluxes. Constraining the model with radiocarbon yielded only a small reduction of uncertainty for the total carbon stocks, while for the individual depth compartments, the uncertainty was increased.},

abstract = {Mixing models are powerful tools for identifying biogeochemical sources and determining mixing fractions in a sample. However, identification of actual source contributors is often not simple, and source compositions typically vary or even overlap, significantly increasing model uncertainty in calculated mixing fractions. This study compares three probabilistic methods, Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR), a pure Monte Carlo technique (PMC), and Stable Isotope Reference Source (SIRS) mixing model, a new technique that estimates mixing in systems with more than three sources and/or uncertain source compositions. In this paper, we use nitrate stable isotope examples ($\delta$15N and $\delta$18O) but all methods tested are applicable to other tracers. In Phase I of a three-phase blind test, we compared methods for a set of six-source nitrate problems. PMC was unable to find solutions for two of the target water samples. The Bayesian method, SIAR, experienced anchoring problems, and SIRS calculated mixing fractions that most closely approximated the known mixing fractions. For that reason, SIRS was the only approach used in the next phase of testing. In Phase II, the problem was broadened where any subset of the six sources could be a possible solution to the mixing problem. Results showed a high rate of Type I errors where solutions included sources that were not contributing to the sample. In Phase III some sources were eliminated based on assumed site knowledge and assumed nitrate concentrations, substantially reducedmixing fraction uncertainties and lowered the Type I error rate. These results demonstrate that valuable insights into stable isotope mixing problems result from probabilistic mixing model approaches like SIRS. The results also emphasize the importance of identifying a minimal set of potential sources and quantifying uncertainties in source isotopic composition as well as demonstrating the value of additional information in reducing the uncertainty in calculated mixing fractions. 1.

abstract = {Biomass is increasingly used as an alternative source for energy in Europe. Woody material cut from hedges is considered to provide a suitable complement to maize and oilseed rape, which are currently the dominant biomass sources. Since shrubs and trees are also important habitats for birds, however, coppicing of hedges at the landscape scale may adversely affect the diversity of the avifauna. To evaluate this risk, we estimated the response of hedge birds to three management scenarios differing in cutting intensity and hedge selection. The analysis was done using hedge data of the Lautertal municipality (n = 339 hedges; Vogelsberg area, Hesse, Germany). It focused on 25 bird species, which are all listed in the hedge programme of the German Ornithological Stations. Information on the preferences of these birds for certain hedge features such as height or width was gathered by an extensive literature review. A cluster analysis on the consolidated literature data allowed us to identify three groups of birds according to their preference for certain hedge attributes. Two groups, which included Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella L.) (i) and Blackbird (Turdus merula L.) (ii), favoured trees located in hedges, but differed in their preference for hedge shape, with (i) being attracted by long and broad hedges and (ii) by high hedges. The third group, which included the Whitethroat (Sylvia communis L.), preferred small hedges with gaps and medium vegetation density. Spatially explicit suitability models based on these data allowed us to predict the status quo of hedge suitability for these species groups. Field surveys proved the accuracy of the predictions to be sufficient, since the hedge suitability predicted was significantly and positively correlated to the occurrence of 9 out of the 12 testable focal species. Our models predicted biomass extraction to almost always reduce hedge suitability for the three bird groups. Concerning the Yellowhammer and the Blackbird group, a high level of biomass extraction reduced hedge suitability by approximately 20%. We thus conclude that intensively extracting biomass can significantly reduce hedge suitability for birds, despite considerable differences in habitat requirements. Considering the variable response of the bird groups to our scenarios as well as the variation in habitat occupancy by birds, however, cutting woody material from hedges nevertheless provides an option to reduce adverse effects of bioenergy production on biodiversity at the landscape scale, as long as hedge management is based on the best knowledge available.},

abstract = {Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources. However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), in addition to the graphical techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE > 0.50 and RSR < 0.70, and if PBIAS ? 25% for streamflow, PBIAS ? 55% for sediment, and PBIAS ? 70% for N and P. For PBIAS, constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided.},

abstract = {The development of low-input farming systems requires knowledge of the extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into three groups (I-III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C, $\beta$-glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the field. Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense pan below ploughing depth. In group I, the H-soils were heavily trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0.2-3.0 $\mu$m pores ('protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not explain a lower microbial biomass for two soils dressed only with synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory methods and descriptive methods in the field. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The stand state was defined by the number of spruce, pine, birch and other broadleaved trees by hectare in 15 diameter classes from 50 to 750 mm. The change in stand state over 5 years was predicted with state-dependent matrices based on equations for recruitment, growth and mortality. The data came from 7241 plots of the National Forest Inventory of Norway, measured from 1994 to 2005. A short-term validation was carried out by comparing predicted and actual growth over 10 years on 416 plots not used in model estimation. The model was also used to predict the long-term growth of stands with different initial species composition and diameter distribution. Irrespective of the initial condition the same steady state resulted, with characteristics similar to those observed in stands that had been undisturbed for 75 years. {\textcopyright} 2008 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above- and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than ∼30 cm.

abstract = {Priming of soil organic matter decomposition has attracted much research interest, yet a conclusive mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon remains elusive. One proposal is that low molecular weight organic substances might “trigger” an acceleration of microbial metabolism. For the first time, we applied a glucose analogue to soil to demonstrate triggering of microbial metabolism, and to estimate its relative contribution to priming. “Non-metabolizable” glucose analogues have been widely used in pure culture studies to mimic glucose, but never in soil biochemistry. We hypothesized that analogue molecules will elicit a metabolic response in microorganisms despite limited catabolism, and thereby confirm the proposed triggering. The effect of14C-labeled 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (OMG) – a common “non-metabolizable” glucose analogue – on soil organic matter mineralization was compared to that of14C-labeled D-glucose. OMG was mineralized, but its mineralization was initially impeded and substantially delayed, relative to glucose. OMG caused brief but strong priming in the first 24 h, increasing unlabeled CO2efflux by 173%, 89% and 36% above control for additions of 0.49, 2.4 and 4.9 $\mu$mol OMG g−1soil, respectively. In contrast, glucose caused low or negative priming on the first day. On the first day after OMG addition, a negative correlation between priming and OMG mineralization indicated that triggering is a valid mechanism of microbial activation during a famine-feast transition, but is short-lived. Glucose mineralization peaked on the second day for medium and high additions, coinciding with peaks in positive priming. Maximum substrate mineralization also coincided with peaks in priming for medium and high OMG levels, but these occurred 9 and 11 days after addition, respectively. This revealed non-triggering priming mechanisms, which contributed most to priming and were closely coupled to substrate mineralization. By separating energy- and substrate-dependent metabolic processes from triggering processes, the glucose analogue 3-O-methyl-D-glucose enabled triggering to be demonstrated, but triggering by glucose occurs without contributing greatly to priming.},

abstract = {Soil microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of organic C allocated to growth over organic C taken up, strongly affects soil carbon (C) cycling. Despite the importance of the microbial CUE for the terrestrial C cycle, very little is known about how it is affected by nutrient availability. Therefore, we studied microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover time in soils of a long-term fertilization experiment in a temperate grassland comprising five treatments (control, PK, NK, NP, NPK). Microbial CUE and the turnover of microbial biomass were determined using a novel substrate-independent method based on incorporation of18O from labeled water into microbial DNA. Microbial respiration was 28-37% smaller in all three N treatments (NK, NP, and NPK) compared to the control, whereas the PK treatment did not affect microbial respiration. N-fertilization decreased microbial C uptake, while the microbial growth rate was not affected. Microbial CUE ranged between 0.31 and 0.45, and was 1.3- to 1.4-fold higher in the N-fertilized soils than in the control. The turnover time ranged between 80 and 113 days and was not significantly affected by fertilization. Net primary production (NPP) and the abundance of legumes differed strongly across the treatments, and the fungal:bacterial ratio was very low in all treatments. Structural equation modeling revealed that microbial CUE was exclusively controlled by N fertilization and that neither the abundance of legumes (as a proxy for the quality of the organic matter inputs) nor NPP (as a proxy for C inputs) had an effect on microbial CUE. Our results show that N fertilization did not only decrease microbial respiration, but also microbial C uptake, indicating that less C was intracellularly processed in the N fertilized soils. The reason for reduced C uptake and increased CUE in the N-fertilization treatments is likely an inhibition of oxidative enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds by N in combination with a reduced energy requirement for microbial N acquisition in the fertilized soils. In conclusion, the study shows that N availability can control soil C cycling by affecting microbial CUE, while plant community-mediated changes in organic matter inputs and P and K availability played no important role for C partitioning of the microbial community in this temperate grassland.},

abstract = {Forests are increasingly threatened by windthrows but those composed of uneven-aged stand plots are generally less impacted by their effects. As a consequence, the management of such forests should be based on a joint management of all their different uneven-aged stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of uneven-aged forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of uneven-aged stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of uneven-aged forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint uneven-aged forest management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent uneven-aged forest management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint uneven-aged forest management model. Second, we find that the independent uneven-aged forest management model poorly approximates the optimal multi-stand harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.},

abstract = {This chronosequential study focuses on the vegetation succession, pedogenesis, carbon stocks, and functionally different carbon pools of post-agrogenic chernozems under self-restoration in the forest steppe zone of the European part of Russia. The sites investigated were comparable in terms of climate, soil texture, and land-use history, but differed in their duration of agricultural abandonment, covering 8, 19, 37, and 59years of self-restoration. During self-restoration, the vegetation showed development towards virgin steppe and the soils towards natural chernozem. Pedogenesis resulted in the formation of a fine granular structure and loss of ploughing features. Organic carbon (OC) content increased from 38.9g kg-1to 54.5g kg-1in the upper 10cm of topsoil. Increasing C contents did not reach the OC level of the natural chernozem, showing 78.9g kg-1. Nitrogen contents and cation exchange capacity (CEC) values increased, showing significant positive correlations with soil organic carbon (SOC) content and resulting in chronosequential constant Corg/N ratios. The SOC accumulation rate for the 59years of self-restoration was about 52g m-2y-1for the mean of the upper 0.2m and 103g m-2y-1in the upper 0.5m. Thus, carbon stocks increased to 91% of the natural chernozem. Functionally different SOC pools showed their quantitative alterations during self-restoration. The OC of the clay fraction (% of soil) increased in line with the recovery of total SOC at soil depths 0-0.5m from 1.49% to 2.17% on average. The OC of the density fraction <1.8g cm-3(free particulate organic matter (POM) and occluded POM) and OC from sand and coarse silt fractions increased only in the upper 10cm of topsoil. After 59years of self-restoration, the rate of occluded POM (19.8% of SOC) still did not match the level of the natural chernozem (26.3% of SOC). The results of the study show an increasing SOC sink during the self-restoration of chernozems but no full restoration within the investigated time scale of 59years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although the root system is indispensable for absorption of nutrients and water, it is poorly studied in maize owing to the difficulties of direct measurement of roots. Here, 103 maize lines were used to compare root architectures under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. Significant genetic variation, with medium to high heritability and significant correlations, was observed for root traits. Total root length (TRL) and total root surface area (TSA) had high phenotypical diversity, and TRL was positively correlated with TSA, root volume, and root forks. The first two principal components explained 94.01% and 91.15% of total root variation in well-watered and water-stressed conditions, respectively. Thus, TRL and TSA, major contributors to root variation, can be used as favorable selection criteria at the seedling stage. We found that stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk groups (temperate backgrounds) showed relatively higher mean values for root morphological diversity than the TST group (tropical/subtropical background). Of the tested lines, 7, 42, 45, and 9 were classified as drought sensitive, moderately sensitive, moderately drought tolerant, and highly drought tolerant, respectively. Seven of the 9 extremely drought tolerant lines were from the TST group, suggesting that TST germplasms harbor valuable genetic resources for drought tolerance that could be used in breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in maize.},

Using the McKendrick-von F\"orster equation, we show that the mean ages of mass in a compartmental system satisfy a linear nonautonomous ordinary differential equation that is exponentially stable. We then define a nonautonomous version of transit time as the mean age of mass leaving the compartmental system at a particular time and show that our nonautonomous theory generalises the autonomous case. We apply these results to study a nine-dimensional nonautonomous compartmental system modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is a modification of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model, and we demonstrate that the nonautonomous versions of transit time and mean age differ significantly from the autonomous quantities when calculated for that model.},

abstract = {Turf management on golf courses entails frequent maintenance activities, such as mowing, irrigation and fertilisation, and relies on purchased inputs for optimal performance and aesthetic quality. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, this study evaluated energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from management of two Swedish golf courses, divided into green, tee, fairway and rough, and identified options for improved management. Energy use and GHG emissions per unit area were highest for greens, followed by tees, fairways and roughs. However, when considering the entire golf course, both energy use and GHG emissions were mainly related to fairway and rough maintenance due to their larger area. Emissions of GHG for the two golf courses were 1.0 and 1.6 Mg CO2e ha−1 year−1 as an area-weighted average, while the energy use was 14 and 19 GJ ha−1 year−1. Mowing was the most energy-consuming activity, contributing 21 and 27% of the primary energy use for the two golf courses. In addition, irrigation and manufacturing of mineral fertiliser and machinery resulted in considerable energy use. Mowing and emissions associated with fertilisation (manufacturing of N fertiliser and soil emissions of N2O occurring after application) contributed most to GHG emissions. Including the estimated mean annual soil C sequestration rate for fairway and rough in the assessment considerably reduced the carbon footprint for fairway and turned the rough into a sink for GHG. Emissions of N2O from decomposition of grass clippings may be a potential hotspot for GHG emissions, but the high spatial and temporal variability of values reported in the literature makes it difficult to estimate these emissions for specific management regimes. Lowering the application rate of N mineral fertiliser, particularly on fairways, should be a high priority for golf courses trying to reduce their carbon footprint. However, measures must be adapted to the prevailing conditions at the specific golf course and the requirements set by golfers.},

abstract = {The climate impacts from bioenergy involve an important time aspect. Using forest residues for energy may result in high initial emissions, but net emissions are reduced over time since, if the residues were left on the ground, they would decompose and release CO2 to the atmosphere. This article investigates the climate impacts from bioenergy with special focus on the time aspects. More specifically, we analyze the climate impacts of forest residues and stumps where combustion related emissions are compensated by avoided emissions from leaving them on the ground to decompose. These biofuels are compared with fossil gas and coal. Net emissions are defined as emissions from utilizing the fuel minus emissions from a reference case of no utilization. Climate impacts are estimated using the measures radiative forcing and global average surface temperature. We find that the climate impacts from using forest residues and stumps depend on the decomposition rates and the time perspective over which the analysis is done. Over a 100 year perspective, branches and tops have lower climate impacts than stumps which in turn have lower impacts than fossil gas and coal. Over a 20 year time perspective, branches and tops have lower climate impacts than all other fuels but the relative difference is smaller. However, stumps have slightly higher climate impacts over 20 years than fossil gas but lower impacts than coal. Regarding metrics for climate impacts, over shorter time scales, approximately 30 years or less, radiative forcing overestimates the climate impacts compared with impacts expressed by global surface temperature change, which is due to the inertia of the climate system. We also find that establishing willow on earlier crop land may reduce atmospheric CO2, provided new land is available. However, these results are inconclusive since we haven't considered the effects of producing the agricultural crops elsewhere.},

As the severity of water stress increased, measurements were made of leaf and root solute and water potentials, leaf diffusive conductance and leaf and root growth. After day four of the drying cycle, the rate of leaf extension and the development of leaf area were reduced. This reduction correlated well with a reduction in leaf turgor which occurred at this time. A significant accumulation of solutes in the root tips of the unwatered plants resulted in the maintenance of root turgor for the duration of the water stress treatment. Root growth of the unwatered plants was also maintained as the severity of water stress increased. A mild degree of water stress resulted in a net increase in root growth compared to the situation in well-watered plants. The significance of solute regulation and continued root growth for plants growing in drying soil is discussed.},

abstract = {Main conclusion: Although grass pea is an environmentally successful robust legume with major traits of interest for food and nutrition security, the genetic potential of this orphan crop has long been neglected. Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a Neolithic plant that has survived millennia of cultivation and has spread over three continents. It is a robust legume crop that is considered one of the most resilient to climate changes and to be survival food during drought-triggered famines. The hardy penetrating root system allows the cultivation of grass pea in various soil types, including marginal ones. As an efficient nitrogen fixer, it meets its own nitrogen requirements and positively benefits subsequent crops. However, already in ancient India and Greece, overconsumption of the seeds and a crippling neurological disorder, later coined neurolathyrism, had been linked. Overemphasis of their suspected toxic properties has led to disregard the plant's exceptionally positive agronomic properties and dietary advantages. In normal socio-economic and environmental situations, in which grass pea is part of a balanced diet, neurolathyrism is virtually non-existent. The etiology of neurolathyrism has been oversimplified and the deficiency in methionine in the diet has been overlooked. In view of the global climate change, this very adaptable and nutritious orphan crop deserves more attention. Grass pea can become a wonder crop if the double stigma on its reputation as a toxic plant and as food of the poor can be disregarded. Additionally, recent research has exposed the potential of grass pea as a health-promoting nutraceutical. Development of varieties with an improved balance in essential amino acids and diet may be relevant to enhance the nutritional value without jeopardizing the multiple stress tolerance of this promising crop.},

abstract = {The performance of a novel, transmission-mode, portable, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyzer was evaluated and compared to that of a benchtop attenu-ated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectrometer. The total concentration of trans fatty acids in the fat extracted from 19 representative fast foods was rapidly (\5 min) quanti-fied in a single measurement after conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). While the FTIR determination is rapid, the time required for extraction and derivatization is not. For all extracts, the total trans FAME concentration varied from approximately 0.5 to 11 % (of total FAME) as determined using the portable FTIR analyzer. The trans fat contents (mean ± SD), expressed in grams per serving and calculated on the basis of total fat content and FTIR determination of trans fat content, were found to be 1.00 ± 0.42 for hamburgers, 0.67 ± 0.78 for chicken tenders, 1.00 ± 1.24 for French fries, and 0.27 ± 0.23 for apple pies. Determinations of total trans-unsaturated FAME were consistent with those obtained by use of ATR-FTIR and GC official methods (AOCS Cd 14e-09 and AOCS Ce 1j-07, respectively). These results indicate that the portable FTIR analyzer is suitable for the rapid and routine quantification of total trans fat measured as FAME prepared from fats extracted from fast foods.},

Applications of the framework involve the study of the ‘environmental spaces' and ‘cultural practices' that contribute to the realisation of benefits to well-being. In this paper empirical work is undertaken to inform the CES evidence base informing management priorities of the Northern Devon Nature Improvement Area (NDNIA) in south west England. Findings from a questionnaire survey, qualitative mapping, group discussion and a participatory arts-based research process are presented to document the many and diverse ways this study area matters to local communities. The paper analyses the qualities that research participants attribute to the environmental space of the NDNIA, the cultural practices conducted and enabled within it, and their associated benefits. The implications of the study for applying this framework through mixed methodological research are discussed, alongside an account of the impact of this approach within the NDNIA itself.},

Agricultural practices were evaluated within the framework set by global food demand and limited area available for agricultural production. Among options for higher C sequestration, we found minimizing the time with bare soil, improving recycling of organic materials and increasing yields through N fertilization to be efficient. Indeed, our results suggest that C stocks can increase with 1-2 kg C for each kg of mineral N fertilizer applied. Possibilities to decrease C emissions by reduced tillage were found to be limited under Nordic conditions. Options for reducing C emissions from drained cultivated organic soils are limited when used as cropland. Extensive production leads to lower soil C stocks and requires more land. Increasing photosynthesis at the global scale by intensification of crop production was found to be the most effective mitigation option and is a prerequisite for preventing further areal expansion of agriculture.},

Currently, poor understanding precludes the incorporation of these priming mechanisms into the global carbon models used for future projections. Here, we show that priming can be incorporated based on a simple equation calibrated from incubation and verified against independent litter manipulation experiments in the global land surface model, ORCHIDEE. When incorporated into ORCHIDEE, priming improved the model's representation of global soil carbon stocks and decreased soil carbon sequestration by 51% (12 ± 3 Pg C) during the period 1901?2010. Future projections with the same model across the range of CO2 and climate changes defined by the IPCC?RCP scenarios reveal that priming buffers the projected changes in soil carbon stocks ? both the increases due to enhanced productivity and new input to the soil, and the decreases due to warming?induced accelerated decomposition. Including priming in Earth system models leads to different projections of soil carbon changes, which are challenging to verify at large spatial scales.},

Due to a long history of sustained yield wood production to satisfy the needs of the forest industry, clearfelling management systems are used in ∼96 per cent of managed forests in Sweden. To satisfy the intentions of contemporary forest and land use policies, uneven-aged forest management systems as a complement are currently debated. We interviewed local forestry stakeholders in the Swedish boreal forest region's north and south about their views on and attitudes towards different forest management systems' contribution to SFM. Most stakeholders were generally negative to the use of uneven-aged system for sustained yield wood production but saw advantages for ecological and socio-cultural dimensions of SFM. To encourage the use of even-aged cohort and uneven-aged systems to satisfy all dimensions of SFM, there is a need for improved communication, education and public awareness. This could ultimately lead to a more constructive and less heated debate. In addition, there is a need of more empirically based knowledge about uneven-aged and cohort forest management systems' pros and cons when it comes to satisfying economical, ecological and socio-cultural objectives. {\textcopyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2011.

abstract = {Sequestration of atmospheric CO2 as organic carbon by agricultural soils (SOC) is promoted as a climate change mitigation option. IPCC provides guidelines for determining carbon stocks and sequestration potential, incentivising policy changes towards management of farmland for carbon sequestration. However, the basis of the assumption that agricultural soils can sequester significant atmospheric CO2 has been questioned. We sought to determine the potential for conversion of arable cropland to grassland to sequester carbon in the short to medium term and potential limiting factors. There were no differences in SOC stocks in the top 30 cm between grassland up to 17 years old and arable cropland at 14 sites across the UK. However, SOC showed different distribution patterns, being concentrated in the top 10 cm under grassland. Soil microbial communities were significantly different between arable and grassland, with higher biomass and lesser dominance by bacteria in grassland soils. A land use conversion experiment showed these changes occurred within one year of land use change. Failure of grassland soils to accumulate SOC was attributed to reduced available soil nitrogen, resulting in low productivity. The implications of these results for carbon sequestration in soils as a climate change mitigation strategy are discussed.},

abstract = {Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978–2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of > 100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.},

abstract = {Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was measured with eddy covariance method for two adjacent forests located at the southern boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999g-2004. The two spruce forests shared similar vegetation composition but differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF) possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table (>60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and g-1440 kg C ha &minus;1yr&minus;1 for WSF and DSF, respectively) indicated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and g-2200 kg C ha &minus;1yr&minus;1 for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil heterotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO2; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more organic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decomposition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO2. The general effect of water table variation on wetland carbon balance observed from this modeling study could be applicable for a wide range of wetland ecosystems that have accumulated soil organic carbon while face hydrological changes under certain climatic or land-use change scenarios.},

We summarize current understanding about human perturbation of the global carbon cycle, examine three scientific issues and consider implications for the interpretation of international climate change policy decisions, concluding that considering carbon storage on land as a means to ‘offset' CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels (an idea with wide currency) is scientifically flawed. The capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon is finite and the current sequestration potential primarily reflects depletion due to past land use. Avoiding emissions from land carbon stocks and refilling depleted stocks reduces atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the maximum amount of this reduction is equivalent to only a small fraction of potential fossil fuel emissions.

abstract = {A field-scale manipulation experiment conducted for 16 years in a Norway spruce forest at Solling, Central Germany, was used to follow the long-term response of total soil bacteria, nitrate reducers and denitrifiers under conditions of reduced N deposition. N was experimentally removed from throughfall by a roof construction ('clean rain plot'). We used substrate-induced respiration (SIR) to characterize the active fraction of soil microbial biomass and potential nitrate reduction to quantify the activity of nitrate reducers. The abundance of total bacteria, nitrate reducers and denitrifiers in different soil layers was analysed by quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA gene, nitrate reduction and denitrification genes. Reduced N deposition temporarily affected the active fraction of the total microbial community (SIR) as well as nitrate reductase activity. However, the size of the total, nitrate reducer and denitrifier communities did not respond to reduced N deposition. Soil depth and sampling date had a greater influence on the density and activity of soil microorganisms than reduced deposition. An increase in the nosZ/16S rRNA gene and nosZ/nirK ratios with soil depth suggests that the proportion of denitrifiers capable of reducing N(2)O into N(2) is larger in the mineral soil layer than in the organic layer.},

abstract = {Estimating root production has been difficult due to multiple potential biases associated with both old and new methods. This shortgrass steppe site is the only place we are aware of that can compare most methods including sequential coring, ingrowth cores, and ingrowth donuts, (14)C pulse-isotope dilution, (14)C pulse-isotope turnover, rhizotron windows, and minirhizotron, and indirect methods including nitrogen budget, carbon flux, simulation carbon flow model, and regression model. We used the studies at this site, other comparisons, a summary of potential directional biases, and different ways of calculating estimates in a logical, comparative approach of evaluating methods. Much of the literature for root production is based on sequential biomass coring, a method resulting in erroneous estimates. Root ingrowth estimates of production are generally conservative compared to minirhizotron and isotope turnover methods. The size of the ingrowth area may be the most important determinant of the underestimation. Estimates based on pulse-isotope dilution are also erroneous due to non-uniform labeling of tissues. Uniform labeling is not an assumption of the pulse-isotope turnover method, and this method has the least severe potential biases. Root production estimates from pulse-isotope turnover were lower than those using minirhizotron when the most common method of calculation was used. This agrees with literature concerning bomb (14)C continuous-isotope labeling comparisons with minirhizotron, although some potential biases between isotope methods are different. However, good agreement between pulse-isotope turnover and minirhizotron were obtained when minirhizotron estimates were calculated from regression of decomposition versus production to equilibrium and when pulse-isotope turnover estimates were calculated from two-phase life-span regressions. This minirhizotron method bypasses biases associated with the artificial surface similar to root-cohort methods that may be practical only in mesic systems, and takes into account both short- and long-lived roots and corrects for soil-isotope contamination that the continuous-isotope labeling bomb (14)C method is not able to account for. Comparisons of these direct methods are also made with four indirect methods.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposes both inside and outside of cells. Cellular metabolism and extracellular depolymerization normally operate simultaneously in soil but are difficult to separate in practice. To learn more about the extracellular component of SOM decomposition, we sterilized a semiarid annual grassland soil to inhibit cellular metabolism, and then assayed cell viability, exoenzyme activities, and pathways of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Chloroform (CHCl3) fumigation was intended to disrupt cellular activities while leaving biochemical processes intact. Gamma ($\gamma$) irradiation and autoclaving were intended to disrupt both cellular and extracellular biochemical processes while leaving abiotic processes intact. We measured the potential activities of eight enzymes (six hydrolytic, two oxidative) and CO2 emission induced by seven substrates (glucose, three amino acids, three tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle intermediates). We found that all three sterilization techniques clearly disrupted cellular metabolism. Chloroform and irradiation decreased cultivable cell counts by 2-3 orders of magnitude, inhibited CO2 emission pathways associated with glucose and amino acids, and decreased the hydrolytic activities of $\alpha$-glucosidase and xylosidase by 72-82%. The other hydrolytic enzymes ($\beta$-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, NAGase, phosphatase) were less sensitive to both CHCl3 and irradiation. All hydrolytic activities that we assayed were inhibited by autoclaving, indicating that biochemical reactions and other extracellular processes drive hydrolytic SOM decomposition. Oxidative activities, on the other hand, did not stop after autoclaving or even combusting at 500°C. This supports other studies which have found that mineral catalysts partly drive oxidative SOM decomposition. Unexpectedly, CO2 emission from TCA intermediates decreased by only 26-47% after sterilization suggesting that the required dehydrogenase enzymes for decarboxylation are still active when cells are dead but relatively intact. Because CHCl3 had slightly smaller effects on exoenzyme activities compared to irradiation, and because it may be continuously applied, limiting the potential for recolonization and regrowth (unlike irradiation), we suggest it is an adequate and more accessible method for separating the activity of exoenzymes from cellular metabolism under realistic soil conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {Sweden has the potential to increase fuel pellet production from alternative raw materials, such as willow and poplar, and also to use former agricultural land for energy crop production. This study used a life cycle perspective to investigate district heat production from pellets produced from willow or poplar cultivated on fallow land in Sweden. The energy efficiency and global warming potential of the systems was evaluated, additionally was the climate impact, expressed in global mean surface temperature change, evaluated from annual greenhouse gas data, including the most relevant fossil and biogenic sources and sinks. The systems were also compared with a fossil fuel alternative in which coal was assumed to be used for heat production. The results showed that the systems investigated had a cooling effect on both global mean surface temperature and global warming potential within the 100-year study period owing mainly to an increase in live biomass and a more long-term increase in soil organic carbon (C), which shows the importance of land use. At the same time, the systems produced renewable energy. The poplar system contributed to a larger cooling effect than the willow system due to more C being sequestered in live biomass and soil in the longer growth periods between harvests and to higher yield. The energy efficiency of the willow and poplar systems used for pellet fuel production was about 11 times the energy input.},

abstract = {Tree stumps are a potential bioenergy resource to replace fossil fuels and meet the targets for reduced CO2 emissions. However, the effects of stump harvesting on wood-dependent organisms are poorly known. This study assessed the abundances of macroarthropods, especially non-coleopteran groups, in wood, bark and 'periphery' of stumps in comparison with soil to evaluate which species/taxa prefer stumps over soil and would risk a significant population decline following extensive stump harvesting. To assess the effects of stump age on species and individual numbers, 5-, 10- and 20-yr-old stumps were studied at three sites in southern and central Sweden. For each site and age class, stumps of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) were compared. Samples of wood and bark were taken from the full height of the stump and samples of periphery and soil to a depth of 10cm. The samples were placed in Tullgren funnels for animal extraction during 4days. A total of 56 species or other taxonomic groups not belonging to Coleoptera were identified. Bark (including the space between bark and wood) had significantly lower species richness of non-coleopteran macroarthropods but higher abundance per m2 (of cut stump surface) than soil in 10-yr-old stands, which on average contained higher abundances than the other age classes. No significant differences were found between spruce and pine stumps, indicating that one of the tree species can act as a substitute after stump harvesting of the other. Viewed over all substrates, Diplopoda, Coleoptera, Diptera (larvae) and Homoptera contributed most to the total abundance (29, 20, 17 and 15%, respectively). Of these groups, Diplopoda were much more abundant in bark (98%) than in soil (2%). The most common diplopod species was Proteroiulus fuscus, which often demonstrated 100-fold higher abundances (per sample unit) in bark and wood than in soil. Six species/taxa had clearly higher abundances in stumps than in soil. Stump harvesting would thus markedly reduce preferred habitats for these taxa. It is also possible that some species generally considered as soil animals might be occasionally dependent on stumps for, e.g. egg-laying and hatching. For such species, stump harvesting would be more detrimental than indicated by this population survey. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Agricultural management effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) can be significant, but are often relatively small compared with the total SOC pool and its field-scale variability. In field experiments, completely uniform initial SOC concentrations across all plots are unlikely. Therefore, measured treatment effects through time are biased by these initial differences. This study questioned how much this bias can represent and whether it can be neglected or must be accounted for. In 1116 investigated pairs of treatments in 10 meta-replicated Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments, the average absolute initial difference in SOC was 1.3g Ckg-1, whereas the average absolute difference after about 50years of contrasting management was 1.5g Ckg-1. Initial differences in SOC were significantly correlated with final differences (R2=0.14) and in 47% of all investigated pairs the absolute initial difference was higher than the absolute final difference. However, simple subtraction of initial differences between pairs from final differences to isolate the treatment effect neglect the fact that the soil with the higher initial SOC content will lose proportionally more C through mineralization during the experimental period higher SOC content caused higher SOC mineralisation during the experimental period. Therefore, a first-order kinetic model was used to predict the decrease in initial SOC differences over time as influenced by climate. We derived a generic empirical equation that can be used to account for this severe but inherent problem with plot experiments. According to the equation, 65 and 69% of the initial differences in SOC between treatment pairs persisted after 50years under the climate conditions in southern and central Sweden, respectively. We conclude that initial differences can be severe and have to be accounted for. The proposed empirical equation can reduce the bias in treatment comparisons for different climatic conditions and contribute to improve the quality of data interpretation from long-term field experiments.},

abstract = {Simulation models represent soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in global carbon (C) cycle scenarios to support climate-change studies. It is imperative to increase confidence in long-term predictions of SOC dynamics by reducing the uncertainty in model estimates. We evaluated SOC simulated from an ensemble of 26 process-based C models by comparing simulations to experimental data from seven long-term bare-fallow (vegetation-free) plots at six sites: Denmark (two sites), France, Russia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The decay of SOC in these plots has been monitored for decades since the last inputs of plant material, providing the opportunity to test decomposition without the continuous input of new organic material. The models were run independently over multi-year simulation periods (from 28 to 80 years) in a blind test with no calibration (Bln) and with the following three calibration scenarios, each providing different levels of information and/or allowing different levels of model fitting: (a) calibrating decomposition parameters separately at each experimental site (Spe); (b) using a generic, knowledge-based, parameterization applicable in the Central European region (Gen); and (c) using a combination of both (a) and (b) strategies (Mix). We addressed uncertainties from different modelling approaches with or without spin-up initialization of SOC. Changes in the multi-model median (MMM) of SOC were used as descriptors of the ensemble performance. On average across sites, Gen proved adequate in describing changes in SOC, with MMM equal to average SOC (and standard deviation) of 39.2 (±15.5) Mg C/ha compared to the observed mean of 36.0 (±19.7) Mg C/ha (last observed year), indicating sufficiently reliable SOC estimates. Moving to Mix (37.5 ± 16.7 Mg C/ha) and Spe (36.8 ± 19.8 Mg C/ha) provided only marginal gains in accuracy, but modellers would need to apply more knowledge and a greater calibration effort than in Gen, thereby limiting the wider applicability of models.},

abstract = {The understanding that some natural organic molecules can resist microbial decomposition because of certain molecular properties forms the basis of the biogeochemical paradigm of ‘intrinsic recalcitrance'. In this concept paper I argue that recalcitrance is an indeterminate abstraction whose semantic vagueness encumbers research on terrestrial carbon cycling. Consequently, it appears to be advantageous to view the perceived ‘inherent resistance' to decomposition of some forms of organic matter not as a material property, but as a logistical problem constrained by (i) microbial ecology; (ii) enzyme kinetics; (iii) environmental drivers; and (iv) matrix protection. A consequence of this view would be that the frequently observed temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of organic matter must result from factors other than intrinsic molecular recalcitrance.},

abstract = {Analysis of the isotopic composition of the CO2 respired from soils may reveal information about the important component of the ecosystem C balance. This is crucial, since a large terrestrial sink for atmospheric CO2 has been located in the northern hemisphere, and the vast boreal forests may be largely responsible. At the same time, boreal and arctic ecosystems have large amounts of C stored in the soil, and could potentially become a source of CO2 in a warmer climate promoting more rapid decomposition of soil organic matter. Furthermore, the northern hemisphere has complex dynamics in terms of annual fluctuations in both the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and its $\delta$l3C. It is of utmost importance to understand the causes of this variability, since it interferes with the partitioning between the ocean and the terrestrial contributions in global models. This chapter aims to provide an update on the reviews by Flanagan and Ehleringer and Ehleringer et al. on the causation of the $\delta$13C of the soil CO2 efflux and, in doing this, focuses on the boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Fine roots are the most dynamic portion of a plant's root system and a major source of soil organic matter. By altering plant species diversity and composition, soil conditions and nutrient availability, and consequently belowground allocation and dynamics of root carbon (C) inputs, land-use and management changes may influence organic C storage in terrestrial ecosystems. In three German regions, we measured fine root radiocarbon (14C) content to estimate the mean time since C in root tissues was fixed from the atmosphere in 54 grassland and forest plots with different management and soil conditions. Although root biomass was on average greater in grasslands 5.1 ± 0.8 g (mean ± SE, Combining double low line 27) than in forests 3.1 ± 0.5 g (n Combining double low line 27) (p/0.05), the mean age of C in fine roots in forests averaged 11.3 ± 1.8 yr and was older and more variable compared to grasslands 1.7 ± 0.4 yr (ip < 0.001). We further found that management affects the mean age of fine root C in temperate grasslands mediated by changes in plant species diversity and composition. Fine root mean C age is positively correlated with plant diversity (Combining double low line 0.65) and with the number of perennial species ( Combining double low line 0.77). Fine root mean C age in grasslands was also affected by study region with averages of 0.7 ± 0.1 yr ( Combining double low line 9) on mostly organic soils in northern Germany and of 1.8 ± 0.3 yr (n Combining double low line 9) and 2.6 ± 0.3 (n/Combining double low line 9) in central and southern Germany (ip/i0.05). This was probably due to differences in soil nutrient contents and soil moisture conditions between study regions, which affected plant species diversity and the presence of perennial species. Our results indicate more long-lived roots or internal redistribution of C in perennial species and suggest linkages between fine root C age and management in grasslands. These findings improve our ability to predict and model belowground C fluxes across broader spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {In 1959, Athol Rafter began a substantial programme of systematically monitoring the flow of 14C produced by atmospheric thermonuclear tests through organic matter in New Zealand soils under stable land use. A database of ???500 soil radiocarbon measurements spanning 50 years has now been compiled, and is used here to identify optimal approaches for soil C-cycle studies. Our results confirm the potential of 14C to determine residence times, by estimating the amount of 'bomb 14C' incorporated. High-resolution time series confirm this approach is appropriate, and emphasise that residence times can be calculated routinely with two or more time points as little as 10 years apart. This approach is generally robust to the key assumptions that can create large errors when single time-point 14C measurements are modelled. The three most critical assumptions relate to: (1) the distribution of turnover times, and particularly the proportion of old C ('passive fraction'), (2) the lag time between photosynthesis and C entering the modelled pool, (3) changes in the rates of C input. When carrying out approaches using robust assumptions on time-series samples, multiple soil layers can be aggregated using a mixing equation. Where good archived samples are available, AMS measurements can develop useful understanding for calibrating models of the soil C cycle at regional to continental scales with sample numbers on the order of hundreds rather than thousands. Sample preparation laboratories and AMS facilities can play an important role in coordinating the efficient delivery of robust calculated residence times for soil carbon. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recently, regular oscillations in bacterial populations and growth rates of bacterial feeding nematodes (BFN) were shown to occur after addition of fresh organic matter to soil. This paper presents a model developed to investigate potential mechanisms of those oscillations, and whether they were initiated by bacteria-substrate interactions or by predatory regulation of bacteria. The model was also used to investigate mineral nitrogen release during short-term organic matter decomposition. Experimental data originated from several microcosm experiments with a sandy soil amended with clover-grass mixture. Numbers of bacteria and BFN, and nitrate and ammonium content in soil were measured daily during about a month, whereas protozoa were counted occasionally. A substrate-based food web model was constructed with 3 plant residue and 5 soil organic matter compartments, 3 trophic groups of bacteria (copiotrophic, oligotrophic and hydrolytic), and two predatory groups (BFN and protozoa). Both carbon and nitrogen flows between these compartments were modelled. Fluctuations in microbial populations in soil after plant residue incorporation could be reproduced with and without participation of predators. The first two peaks in bacterial numbers were mainly related to bacteria-substrate interactions, while predators (particularly protozoa) influenced bacterial dynamics during later stages of bacterial community development. Oligotrophic bacteria had a stabilizing effect on fluctuations of other trophic groups, and were the main source of nutrients for predators. A peak in soil ammonium occurred within 1 week after residue incorporation. Nitrate increased sigmoidally after a short lag phase. The final nitrate concentration was primarily determined by bacterial dynamics, and to a lesser extent by protozoa and nematodes. This model indicates the importance of substrate-consumer relations for regulation of populations at different trophic levels and nutrient release from fresh organic matter added to soil. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Significant climate risks are associated with a positive carbon-temperature feedback in northern latitude carbon-rich ecosystems, making an accurate analysis of human impacts on the net greenhouse gas balance of wetlands a priority. Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by CO2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the "cost" of CH4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulse-response radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting for both sustained CH4 emissions and cumulative CO2 exchange.},

abstract = {Reporting results and promoting ideas in science in general, and Earth science in particular, is treated here as storytelling. Just as in literature and drama, storytelling in Earth science is characterized by a small number of basic plots. Though the list is not exhaustive, and acknowledging that multiple or hybrid plots and subplots are possible in a single piece, eight standard plots are identified, and examples provided: cause-and-effect, genesis, emergence, destruction, metamorphosis, convergence, divergence, and oscillation. The plots of Earth science stories are not those of literary traditions, nor those of persuasion or moral philosophy, and deserve separate consideration. Earth science plots do not conform those of storytelling more generally, implying that Earth scientists may have fundamentally different motivations than other storytellers, and that the basic plots of Earth Science derive from the characteristics and behaviors of Earth systems. In some cases preference or affinity to different plots results in fundamentally different interpretations and conclusions of the same evidence. In other situations exploration of additional plots could help resolve scientific controversies. Thus explicit acknowledgement of plots can yield direct scientific benefits. Consideration of plots and storytelling devices may also assist in the interpretation of published work, and can help scientists improve their own storytelling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper provides a framework for articulating how social media networks that are primarily embedded within IT platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, and the “blogosphere” are theoretically different from previous generations of IT-enabled or purely interpersonal networks. Nevertheless, since social media networks potentially differ from these previous networks in a myriad of different ways, it is difficult to articulate a coherent research agenda. After addressing the relationship between social media and social networks, we argue that the source of social capital (structure and content) and locus of agency (user and platform) can be useful for designing a coherent and manageable research agenda examining the distinctive characteristics of social media networks. The initial framework provided can facilitate theorizing and empirical research of social media networks and can be used to generate research questions for future investigations. The work is intended to encourage, not resolve, a robust theoretically driven research agenda regarding social media networks.},

abstract = {Decision Support Systems, and, more recently, participatory and collaborative modelling have emerged as a response to increased focus on stakeholder participation in modelling activities for certain fields like water resources management. Researchers and practitioners frequently use ‘buzzwords' such as ‘participatory modelling' and ‘collaborative modelling'. In some cases, both terms are used interchangeably, largely due to unclear distinction between them in literature. This article draws the line between participatory and collaborative modelling by using levels of participation and cooperation as conditioning dimensions. Based on this methodology, a new generic framework is presented. This framework can help identify determinant features of both modelling approaches currently used in water resources management. It permits analysis of these approaches in terms of context, specific use, information handling, stakeholder involvement, modelling team and means. The article concludes with an application of the framework to a collaborative modelling approach carried out for a groundwater study in the Netherlands.},

abstract = {Ozone (O-3) and nitrogen (N) deposition affect plant carbon (C) dynamics and may change ecosystem C-sink/-source properties. We studied effects of increased background [O-3] (up to [ambient] x 2) and increased N deposition (up to +50 kg ha-1 a-1) on mature, subalpine grassland during the third treatment year. During 10 days and 13 nights, distributed evenly over the growth period of 2006, we measured ecosystem-level CO2 exchange using a static cuvette. Light dependency of gross primary production (GPP) and temperature dependency of ecosystem respiration rates (R-eco) were established. Soil temperature, soil water content, and solar radiation were monitored. Using R-eco and GPP values, we calculated seasonal net ecosystem production (NEP), based on hourly averages of global radiation and soil temperature. Differences in NEP were compared with differences in soil organic C after 5 years of treatment. The high [O-3] had no effect on aboveground dry matter productivity (DM), but seasonal mean rates of both R-eco and GPP decreased ca. 8%. NEP indicated an unaltered growing season CO2-C balance. High N treatment, with a +31% increase in DM, mean R-eco increased ca. 3%, but GPP decreased ca. 4%. Consequently, seasonal NEP yielded a 53.9 g C m-2 (+/- 22.05) C loss compared with control. Independent of treatment, we observed a negative NEP of 146.4 g C m-2 (+/- 15.3). Carbon loss was likely due to a transient management effect, equivalent to a shift from pasture to hay meadow and a drought effect, specific to the 2006 summer climate. We argue that this resulted from strongly intensified soil microbial respiration, following mitigation of nutrient limitation. There was no interaction between O-3 and N treatments. Thus, during the 2006 growing season, the subalpine grassland lost > 2% of total topsoil organic C as respired CO2, with increased N deposition responsible for one-third of that loss.},

abstract = {This study will test two hypotheses to determine whether the formation of expectations (prior to the global assignment) affects expatriates' adjustment. This study utilized a sample of seventy-three expatriates who completed questionnaires approximately ten months after arriving in their host countries. All the expatriates had pre-departure cross-cultural training, but the training varied in perceived relevance. The expatriates were assigned either to countries where their native language was spoken (e.g. Americans in the UK) or to countries where their native language was not spoken (e.g. Americans in France). The results of the mediated regression analysis suggest that the more tailored and relevant the pre-departure cross-cultural training, the more expectations were either met or positively exceeded. Analyses suggest that both cross-cultural training and the language spoken in the host country affect the accuracy of expatriates' expectations prior to the assignment - and that having accurate expectations, in turn, positively affects cross-cultural adjustment. The results from this study encourage organizations to develop programmes that will ensure their expatriates have realistic expectations prior to their global assignments (e.g. through tailored cross-cultural training).},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopes can be used to partition the net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) into its photosynthetic and respiratory components, but the method has not been generally adopted due to instrumental and theoretical limitations. Here, motivated by recently improved instrumentation, we extend the theory of isotopic flux partitioning to include photorespiration, foliar daytime 'dark' respiration, and other refinements, arriving at a general yet practical formulation from which all previous formulations can be derived as simplifying approximations. We use a full growing season of isotopic eddy covariance flux data from a temperate deciduous forest to demonstrate the method, quantify its uncertainties, and determine biases associated with previously published formulations. We find that when $\delta$13C of CO2 is acquired with high precision (0.02‰ RMSE for 100s integration times), the statistical uncertainty in the partitioned fluxes is comparable to that in NEE itself-i.e., as good as practicably possible. Assessable systematic uncertainty is ±17% of gross ecosystem production (GEP), due mostly to uncertainty in the isotopic fractionation by carboxylation. Additional, currently unquantifiable systematic uncertainty is associated with treating the canopy as a single "big leaf". Both sources of systematic uncertainty could be greatly reduced by feasible supporting leaf-level measurements. Our extended theory corrects systematic biases in previous isotopic approaches, including overestimation (by 13%) of GEP due to the omission of photorespiration. The partitioning determines the isotopic signature of photosynthesis, which we find to vary seasonally between -24 and -28‰ such that the isotopic disequilibrium between ecosystem carbon input and output remains stable at approximately -0.5‰ through most of the growing season. The key advantage of isotopic partitioning over standard, regression-based partitioning is that it enables controls on the ecosystem-scale photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes to emerge from observations, without having to assume functional relations to environmental drivers a priori. As an example, we show how isotopic partitioning reveals certain large variations in daytime NEE to be caused by shifts in the flux tower sampling footprint between regions of high and low respiratory flux-a finding unobtainable by standard partitioning. For this reason, isotopic partitioning can be more precise than standard partitioning for quantifying environmental controls on NEE.},

abstract = {Current plant phenotyping technologies to characterize agriculturally relevant traits have been primarily developed for use in laboratory and/or greenhouse conditions. In the case of root architectural traits, this limits phenotyping efforts, largely, to young plants grown in specialized containers and growth media. Hence, novel approaches are required to characterize mature root systems of older plants grown under actual soil conditions in the field. Imaging methods able to address the challenges associated with characterizing mature root systems are rare due, in part, to the greater complexity of mature root systems, including the larger size, overlap and diversity of root components. Our imaging solution combines a field imaging protocol and algorithmic approach to analyze mature root systems grown in the field. Via two case studies, we demonstrate how image analysis can be utilized to estimate localized root traits that reliably capture heritable architectural diversity as well as environmentally induced architectural variation of both monocot and dicot plants. In the first study we show that our algorithms and traits (including 13 novel traits inaccessible to manual estimation) can differentiate nine maize genotypes 8 weeks after planting. The second study focuses on a diversity panel of 188 cowpea genotypes to identify which traits are sufficient to differentiate genotypes even when comparing plants whose harvesting date differs up to 14 days. Overall, we find that automatically derived traits can increase both the speed and reproducibility of the trait-estimation pipeline under field conditions.},

abstract = {Knowledge of plant root responses to both favorable and unfavor-able soil conditions is fundamental to our understanding of the com-plex root soil interface. One of the greatest hindrances to the frequent measurements of the morphological and physiological responses of plant roots to soil environmental conditions has been the absence of an inexpensive method for quantitatively separating the soil from roots and other biological materials. The objectives of this study were to develop an inexpensive and quantitative method for separating roots from soils of field and green-house experiments and to determine the influence of soil type, pre-treatment and plant type on the efficiency of separation. A mechanized system which separated roots from soil materials was constructed which combines the kinetic energy of pressurized spray jets and the low energy of air flotation. Root elutriation systems were fabricated from commercially available components at a cost of less than $25 per unit excluding labor. A manifold of these units was assembled to increase operator efficiency. Quantitative separation of roots is achieved by a closed system of mechanical separations using water and air to isolate and deposit roots on a submerged sieve. Washing times range from 3 to 10 min and is a function of soil texture, plant species, concentration of the dispersing agent and soak-ing time. Utilizing a manifold of nine separation units and two per-sonnel, an average of 60 samples could be separated per hour. Water consumption per unit ranges from 2.1 to 3.4 liters per minute. This method, in combination with a powered soil sampler, appears to provide a rapid, quantitative and inexpensive approach for measuring plant root responses to soil biological, chemical, and physical stresses.

The recently proposed Equilibrium Model (EM) provides a quantitative explanation of enzyme thermal behaviour under reaction conditions by introducing an inactive (but not denatured) intermediate in rapid equilibrium with the active form. It was formulated as a mathematical model, and fits the known experimental data. Importantly, the EM gives rise to a number of new insights into the molecular basis of the temperature control of enzymes and their environmental adaptation and evolution, it is consistent with active site properties, and it has fundamental implications for enzyme engineering and other areas of biotechnology.},

abstract = {Global wetlands are believed to be climate sensitive, and are the largest natural emitters of methane (CH4). Increased wetland CH4 emissions could act as a positive feedback to future warming. The Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP) investigated our present ability to simulate large-scale wetland characteristics and corresponding CH4 emissions. To ensure inter-comparability, we used a common experimental protocol driving all models with the same climate and carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing datasets. The WETCHIMP experiments were conducted for model equilibrium states as well as transient simulations covering the last century. Sensitivity experiments investigated model response to changes in selected forcing inputs (precipitation, temperature, and atmospheric CO2 concentration). Ten models participated, covering the spectrum from simple to relatively complex, including models tailored either for regional or global simulations. The models also varied in methods to calculate wetland size and location, with some models simulating wetland area prognostically, while other models relied on remotely sensed inundation datasets, or an approach intermediate between the two. Four major conclusions emerged from the project. First, the suite of models demonstrate extensive disagreement in their simulations of wetland areal extent and CH4 emissions, in both space and time. Simple metrics of wetland area, such as the latitudinal gradient, show large variability, principally between models that use inundation dataset information and those that independently determine wetland area. Agreement between the models improves for zonally summed CH4 emissions, but large variation between the models remains. For annual global CH4 emissions, the models vary by ±40% of the all-model mean (190 Tg CH4 yr−1). Second, all models show a strong positive response to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations (857 ppm) in both CH4 emissions and wetland area. In response to increasing global temperatures (+3.4 °C globally spatially uniform), on average, the models decreased wetland area and CH4 fluxes, primarily in the tropics, but the magnitude and sign of the response varied greatly. Models were least sensitive to increased global precipitation (+3.9 % globally spatially uniform) with a consistent small positive response in CH4 fluxes and wetland area. Results from the 20th century transient simulation show that interactions between climate forcings could have strong non-linear effects. Third, we presently do not have sufficient wetland methane observation datasets adequate to evaluate model fluxes at a spatial scale comparable to model grid cells (commonly 0.5°). This limitation severely restricts our ability to model global wetland CH4 emissions with confidence. Our simulated wetland extents are also difficult to evaluate due to extensive disagreements between wetland mapping and remotely sensed inundation datasets. Fourth, the large range in predicted CH4 emission rates leads to the conclusion that there is both substantial parameter and structural uncertainty in large-scale CH4 emission models, even after uncertainties in wetland areas are accounted for.},

abstract = {Owing to the peculiarities of forest net primary production humans would appropriate ca. 60% of the global increment of woody biomass if forest biomass were to produce 20% of current global primary energy supply. We argue that such an increase in biomass harvest would result in younger forests, lower biomass pools, depleted soil nutrient stocks and a loss of other ecosystem functions. The proposed strategy is likely to miss its main objective, i.e. to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because it would result in a reduction of biomass pools that may take decades to centuries to be paid back by fossil fuel substitution, if paid back at all. Eventually, depleted soil fertility will make the production unsustainable and require fertilization, which in turn increases GHG emissions due to N2O emissions. Hence, large-scale production of bioenergy from forest biomass is neither sustainable nor GHG neutral. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {There is high variability in the level of herbivory between individual plants from the same species with potential effects on population dynamics, community composition, and ecosystem structure and function. This variability can be partly explained by associational effects (i.e., the impact of the presence of neighboring plants on the level of herbivory experienced by a focal plant) but it is still unclear how the spatial scale of plant neighborhood modulates foraging choice of herbivores, an inherently spatial process in itself. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated how spatial scale modifies associational effects on the susceptibility to browsing by herbivores with movement capacities similar to deer. From 2496 articles found in literature databases, we selected 46 studies providing a total of 168 differences of means in damage by herbivores or survival to woody plants (mostly) with and without neighboring plants. Spatial scales were reported as distance between plants or as plot size. We estimated the relationships between the effect sizes and spatial scale, type of associational effects, and nature of the experiment using meta-analysis mixed models. The strength of associational effects declined with increasing plot size, regardless of the type of associational effects. Associational defenses (i.e., decrease in herbivory for focal plants associated with unpalatable neighbors) had stronger magnitude than associational susceptibilities. The high remaining heterogeneity among studies suggests that untested factors modulate associational effects, such as nutritional quality of focal and neighboring plants, density of herbivores, timing of browsing, etc. Associational effects are already considered in multiple restoration contexts worldwide, but a better understanding of these relationships could improve their use in conservation, restoration, and forest exploitation when browsing is a concern. This study is the first to investigate spatial patterns of associational effects across species and ecosystems, an issue that is essential to determine differential herbivory damages among plants.

The system predicts the mortality for 5 yr periods. Data from permanent sample plots of the Swedish National Forest Inventory were used. Independent variables used for steps I and II were specific to site, stand and plot characteristics. In the step III models, which were tree-species specific, competition indices were also included. Logistic regression was used for steps I and III models, while linear regression was used for the step II models. A fair performance of the functions was observed, although mortality is a highly stochastic process. In applications, random simulation in all steps can mimic this.},

Here, we ask: How does litter chemistry change during decomposition, and what roles do decomposers play in these changes? During a long-term (730 days) litter decomposition experiment, we tracked concurrent changes in decomposer community structure and function and litter chemistry using high-resolution molecular techniques. Contrary to the current paradigm, we found that the chemistry of different litter types diverged, rather than converged, during decomposition due to the activities of decomposers. Furthermore, the same litter type exposed to different decomposer communities exhibited striking differences in chemistry, even after > 90% mass loss. Our results show that during decomposition, decomposer community characteristics regulate changes in litter chemistry, which could influence the functionality of litter-derived soil organic matter (SOM) and the turnover and stabilisation of soil C.},

abstract = {In 1959, Athol Rafter began a substantial programme of monitoring the flow of 14 C produced by atmospheric thermonuclear tests through New Zealand's atmosphere, biosphere and soil. By building on the original measurements through ongoing sampling, a database of over 500 soil radiocarbon measurements spanning 50 years has now been compiled. The datasets, including an 11-point time series, allow strong focus on the robust quantification of residence times ranging from years to decades. We describe key aspects of the dataset, including the ability to identify critical assumptions inherent in calculating soil C residence times. The 3 most critical assumptions relate to: (1) the proportion of old C (“fraction passive”), (2) the lag time between photosynthesis and C entering the modeled pool, and (3) changes in the rates of C input (i.e., steady state). We demonstrate the ability to compare residence times in contrasting sites, such Andisols and non-Andisols, and the ability to calculate residence times across a range of soil depths. We use 14 C in a two-box model to quantify soil carbon turnover parameters in deforested dairy pastures under similar climate in the Tokomaru silt loam (non-Andisol) versus the Egmont black loam (Andisol), originally sampled in 1962, 1965 and 1969, and resampled again in 2008. The 14 C-based residence times of the main soil C pool in surface soil ($\sim$8 cm) are $\sim$9 years in the Tokomaru soils compared to $\sim$17 years for the Egmont soils. This difference represents nearly a doubling of soil C residence time, and roughly explains the doubling of the soil C stock. Passive soil C comprises 15% of the soil C pool in Tokomaru soils versus 27% in Egmont soils. A similar difference in residence times is found in a second surface soil comparison between the Bruntwood soil (Andisol) and the Te Kowhai soil (non-Andisol) with residence times of 18 and 27 years, respectively. The comparisons support evidence that C dynamics do differ in Andisols versus non-Andisols, as a result of both the mineral allophane and Al complexation. Expanding our calculations beyond surface soil, we show that thickening the calculation depth by combining horizons allows robust residence times to be calculated at a range of depths. Overall, the large and systematically collected dataset demonstrate that soil C residence times of the main soil C pool can be routinely calculated using 14 C wherever samples collected 10 or more years apart in New Zealand grassland soils are available, and presumably under similar circumstances in other soils worldwide.},

abstract = {In many cooperatively breeding birds, kin selection has an important role in the evolution and maintenance of social behaviour, and ‘helpers' can maximize indirect fitness gains by preferentially allocating care to close relatives. Although there is evidence for kin-biased helping behaviour in several species, the mechanism of kin recognition underlying this behaviour is poorly understood. Vocalizations are the most commonly used cues in avian recognition systems, but the effectiveness of vocal signals as reliable recognition cues must depend on how they are acquired. However, there have been no experimental studies of the development of vocal recognition cues in cooperative birds; indeed, the ontogeny of all bird vocalizations other than song is poorly known in any species. Here, we show that cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) can discriminate between kin and non-kin according to the individual-specific characteristics of contact calls, and show experimentally that individuals learn these calls from provisioning adults during the nestling period. Finally, we show that the pattern of cooperative behaviour in this species is consistent with the use of recognition cues learned through association.},

This study compares carbon balances of CF and CCF, applied as two alternative land-use strategies for a heterogeneous Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand. We use a set of models to analyze the long-term effects of different forest management and wood use strategies in Sweden on carbon dioxide emissions and carbon stock changes. The results show that biomass growth and yield is more important than the choice of silvicultural system per se. When comparing CF and CCF assuming similar growth, extraction and product use, only minor differences in long-term climate benefit were found between the two principally different silvicultural systems.},

abstract = {Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal fungi are important in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in forests, but poor knowledge about EMM biomass and necromass turnovers makes the quantification of their role problematic. We studied the impacts of elevated CO2 and N fertilization on EMM production and turnover in a Pinus taeda forest. EMM C was determined by the analysis of ergosterol (biomass), chitin (total bio- and necromass) and total organic C (TOC) of sand-filled mycelium in-growth bags. The production and turnover of EMM bio- and necromass and total C were estimated by modelling. N fertilization reduced the standing EMM biomass C to 57% and its production to 51% of the control (from 238 to 122 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) ), whereas elevated CO2 had no detectable effects. Biomass turnover was high (˜13 yr(-1) ) and unchanged by the treatments. Necromass turnover was slow and was reduced from 1.5 yr(-1) in the control to 0.65 yr(-1) in the N-fertilized treatment.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). Climate change and stagnating crop yields may cause a decline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils leading to considerable CO 2  emissions and reduced agricultural productivity. Regional model-based SOC projections are needed to evaluate these potential risks. In this study, we simulated the future SOC development in cropland and grassland soils of Bavaria in the 21 st  century. Soils from 51 study sites representing the most important soil classes of Central Europe were fractionated and derived SOC pools were used to initialize the RothC soil carbon model. For each site, long-term C inputs were determined using the C allocation method. Model runs were performed for three different C input scenarios as a realistic range of projected yield development. Our modelling approach revealed substantial SOC decreases of 11-16% under an expected mean temperature increase of 3.3 °C assuming unchanged C inputs. For the scenario of 20% reduced C inputs, agricultural SOC stocks are projected to decline by 19-24%. Remarkably, even the optimistic scenario of 20% increased C inputs led to SOC decreases of 3-8%. Projected SOC changes largely differed among investigated soil classes. Our results indicated that C inputs have to increase by 29% to maintain present SOC stocks in agricultural soils.},

abstract = {Dormancy is an essential strategy for microorganisms to cope with environmental stress. However, global ecosystem models typically ignore microbial dormancy, resulting in notable model uncertainties. To facilitate the consideration of dormancy in these large-scale models, we propose a new microbial physiology component that works for a wide range of substrate availabilities. This new model is based on microbial physiological states and the major parameters are the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates of active microbes and the ratio of dormant to active maintenance rates. A major improvement of our model over extant models is that it can explain the low active microbial fractions commonly observed in undisturbed soils. Our new model shows that the exponentially-increasing respiration from substrate-induced respiration experiments can only be used to determine the maximum specific growth rate and initial active microbial biomass, while the respiration data representing both exponentially-increasing and non-exponentially-increasing phases can robustly determine a range of key parameters including the initial total live biomass, initial active fraction, the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates, and the half-saturation constant. Our new model can be incorporated into existing ecosystem models to account for dormancy in microbially-driven processes and to provide improved estimates of microbial activities.},

abstract = {Energy is continuously transformed in environmental systems through the metabolic activities of living organisms, but little is known about the relationship between the two. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial energetics are controlled by microbial community composition in terrestrial ecosystems. We determined the functional diversity profiles of the soil biota (i.e. multiple substrate-induced respiration and microbial energetics) in soils from an arable ecosystem with contrasting long-term management regimes (54 y). These two functional profiling methods were then related to the soils' microbial community composition. Using isothermal microcalorimetry, we show that direct measures of energetics provide a functional link between energy flows and the composition of belowground microbial communities at a high taxonomic level (Mantel R = 0.4602, P = 0.006). In contrast, this link was not apparent when carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as an aggregate measure of microbial metabolism (Mantel R = 0.2291, P = 0.11). Our work advocates that the microbial energetics approach provides complementary information to soil respiration for investigating the involvement of microbial communities in belowground carbon dynamics. Empirical data of our proposed microbial energetics approach can feed into carbon-climate based ecosystem feedback modeling with the suggested conceptual ecological model as a base.},

abstract = {Peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Drainage, required for agriculture, aerates these organic soils and triggers rapid peat decomposition. In turn, cultivation of organic soils is also accompanied by input of young organic carbon (YOC) from plant residues. The extent to which YOC inputs compensate for oxidative peat loss is unknown. Furthermore, the lability of YOC in organic soils introduced by cultivation has never been examined. Here we studied the amount and lability of YOC in two adjacent drained organic soils by a combined13C and14C approach. Soils have been under intensive arable use for several decades and were both cultivated, inter alia, with corn, a C4 plant. In 1995, one soil was converted from annual cropping to permanent cultivation with Miscanthus x giganteus, another C4 plant, while the other was converted to permanent C3 grassland in 2009. Using $\delta$13C signatures, we analysed the fractions of C4 derived carbon in the soil and in CO2, during one month of soil incubation. This enabled us i) to estimate C4-C accumulation in both soils, and ii) to assess the lability of C4-C carbon that accumulated either at least five years prior to sampling (current grassland soil) or until sampling (current Miscanthus soil). The fraction of C4-C derived SOC in the Miscanthus soil was 0.19 ± 0.024 in the top 30 cm, corresponding to an accumulation rate of 1.6 ± 0.2 t C4-C ha−1yr−1. This accumulation rate is in the range of rates found for fertile mineral soils cultivated with Miscanthus. Yet, this C4-C accumulation rate is below average C-losses of agriculturally used organic soils. The grassland soil contained a smaller fraction of 0.08 ± 0.002 C4-C in SOC. The rates of total CO2emitted from the two soils did not differ, but the fraction of CO2derived from C4-C was significantly higher in the Miscanthus soil (0.53 ± 0.05) than in the grassland (0.29 ± 0.04) soil. Hence, in both soils YOC was more labile than bulk SOC. The ratio between the fraction of decomposing C4-C and C4-C in SOC was the same for both soils indicating a similar lability of currently accumulated and aged C4-C. In both soils, the14C age of emitted CO2was younger than that of SOC, confirming an increased lability of YOC over old SOC.},

Consensus is emerging that microbial materials are an important constituent of stable SOM, and new conceptual and quantitative SOM models are rapidly incorporating this view. However, direct evidence demonstrating that microbial residues account for the chemistry, stability and abundance of SOM is still lacking. Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM. We show that SOM accumulation is driven by distinct microbial communities more so than clay mineralogy, where microbial-derived SOM accumulation is greatest in soils with higher fungal abundances and more efficient microbial biomass production.\r\n\r\n},

Therefore, many physical and chemical properties of a soil are determined using its total SSA. Measurement of SSA is time-consuming and laborious, and its estimation using pedotransfer functions is therefore preferred. The objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the pore-solid interface fractal dimension (D) in soils with different textures from the southern part of Iran using estimated improved particle-size distribution (PSD) from the soil primary particles, i.e. clay, silt and sand; (2) develop a multivariate pedotransfer function to estimate D based on PSD; and (3) develop a multivariate pedotransfer function to link the values of D to the SSA. As a result, two pedotransfer functions are presented for estimation of D and SSA. To estimate SSA, the value of D is first obtained using the presented pedotransfer function and these estimated D values are then used in another pedotransfer function to estimate SSA. The pedotransfer functions were validated and it is concluded that they are able to predict the values of D and SSA accurately.},

Because of the important role the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) have in nitrogen cycling and nitrate leaching, we explored the spatial distribution of their activity, abundance and community composition across a 44-ha large farm divided into an organic and an integrated farming system. The spatial patterns were mapped by geostatistical modeling and correlations to soil properties and ecosystem functioning in terms of nitrate leaching were determined. All measured community components for both AOB and AOA exhibited spatial patterns at the hectare scale. The patchy patterns of community structures did not reflect the farming systems, but the AOB community was weakly related to differences in soil pH and moisture, whereas the AOA community to differences in soil pH and clay content. Soil properties related differently to the size of the communities, with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen correlating positively to AOB abundance, while clay content and pH showed a negative correlation to AOA abundance. Contrasting spatial patterns were observed for the abundance distributions of the two groups indicating that the AOB and AOA may occupy different niches in agro-ecosystems. In addition, the two communities correlated differently to community and ecosystem functions. Our results suggest that the AOA, not the AOB, were contributing to nitrate leaching at the site by providing substrate for the nitrite oxidizers.},

abstract = {Bottom-up estimates from long-term field experiments and modelling are the most commonly used approaches to estimate the carbon (C) sequestration potential of the agricultural sector. However, when data are required at European level, important margins of uncertainty still exist due to the representativeness of local data at large scale or different assumptions and information utilized for running models. In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t C ha(-1)  yr(-1) , while the opposite extreme scenario (100% of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28% of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101-336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100. Modelled carbon sequestration rates compared with values from an ad hoc meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of these estimates.},

abstract = {An understanding of the main factors influencing microbial diversity in soils is necessary to predict the effects of current land-use trends on terrestrial diversity. We used microbial catabolic evenness as a measure of one component of soil microbial diversity. Catabolic evenness was assessed by measuring the short-term respiration responses of soil to a range of simple organic compounds. Differences in catabolic evenness between pasture and other land-uses on matched soils were related to differences in organic C pools (total organic C, microbial biomass C, and potentially mineralizable C). This approach enabled comparison of land-use effects on organic C pools in relation to catabolic evenness without the effects of soil type. In general, microbial catabolic evenness was greatest in soils under pasture and indigenous vegetation (range: 19.7-23.3), and least in soils under cereal/maize/horticultural cropping (range: 16.4-19.6). Soils under mixed cropping land-uses had catabolic evenness that ranged between these extremes (range: 17.7-20.5), but under pine forestry there was no characteristic level of evenness (range: 15.122.3). Catabolic evenness correlated poorly with the absolute values of soil organic C pools (r2< 0.36). However, across a range of paired comparisons between pasture and other land-uses, greater differences in microbial catabolic evenness corresponded with greater differences in organic C (r2=0.76) and, to a lesser degree, with differences in microbial biomass C (r2< 0.45) or potentially mineralizable C (r2< 0.13). Therefore, land-uses that deplete organic C stocks in soils may cause declines in the catabolic diversity of soil microbial communities. Although the implications of this for microbial processes are unknown, maintenance of soil organic C may be important for preservation of microbial diversity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Strength of maize (Zea mays L.) root system can be estimated by vertical root pulling resistance. However, this measurement is both laborious and destructive. Hence, it would be desirable to identify related traits whose measurements are easier and non-destructive. Objectives of this research were to study the variability of a population for root and shoot traits in hydroponic culture and in the field and to evaluate their relationships with vertical root pulling resistance. F3 families derived from the single cross Lo964 × Lo1016 were evaluated together with the two parental inbreds in hydroponic culture (171 families) and in three field environments (118 families). In hydroponic culture, differences among F3 families were highly significant for all traits and transgressive segregation was always found. Heritability ranged from 50 to 85%. A statistically significant association was observed only between seminal root weight and shoot weight (r = 0.72**). In the field, differences among F3 families across environments were highly significant for all traits and transgressive segregation was always found except for plant height and pollen shedding date. Heritability for vertical root pulling resistance was 72%, while for other traits heritability ranged from 56 to 91%. Associations of vertical root pulling resistance vs. both hydroponic and other field traits were biologically negligible even when statistically significant. It can be concluded that, despite the large variability available in the population, indirect selection for hydroponic traits would not be of benefit in improving vertical root pulling resistance under the field conditions studied.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major component in the global carbon cycle. Yet how input of plant litter may influence the loss of SOC through a phenomenon called priming effect remains highly uncertain. Most published results about the priming effect came from short-term investigations for a few weeks or at the most for a few months in duration. The priming effect has not been studied at the annual time scale. In this study for 815 days, we investi-gated the priming effect of added maize leaves on SOC decomposition of two soil types and two treatments (bare fallow for 23 years, and adjacent old-field, represent stable and rela-tively labile SOC, respectively) of SOC stabilities within each soil type, using a natural 13 C-isotope method. Results showed that the variation of the priming effect through time had three distinctive phases for all soils: (1) a strong negative priming phase during the first period (%0–90 days); (2) a pulse of positive priming phase in the middle (%70–160 and 140– 350 days for soils from Hailun and Shenyang stations, respectively); and (3) a relatively sta-bilized phase of priming during the last stage of the incubation (>160 days and >350 days for soils from Hailun and Shenyang stations, respectively). Because of major differences in soil properties, the two soil types produced different cumulative priming effects at the end of the experiment, a positive priming effect of 3–7% for the Mollisol and a negative priming effect of 4–8% for the Alfisol. Although soil types and measurement times modulated most of the variability of the priming effect, relative SOC stabilities also influenced the priming effect for a particular soil type and at a particular dynamic phase. The stable SOC from the bare fallow treatment tended to produce a narrower variability during the first phase of nega-tive priming and also during the second phase of positive priming. Averaged over the entire experiment, the stable SOC (i.e., the bare fallow) was at least as responsive to priming as the relatively labile SOC (i.e., the old-field) if not more responsive. The annual time scale of our experiment allowed us to demonstrate the three distinctive phases of the priming effect. Our results highlight the importance of studying the priming effect by investigating the tem-poral dynamics over longer time scales.

abstract = {Agroforestry-the practice of growing trees and crops in interacting combinations-is recognized worldwide as an integrated approach to sustainable land-use. It is estimated to be practiced over 1 billion hectares in developing countries, and to a lesser extent in the industrialized countries. Agroforestry systems (AFSs) are believed to have a higher potential to sequester carbon (C) because of their perceived ability for greater capture and utilization of growth resources (light, nutrients, and water) than single-species crop or pasture systems. The estimates of C stored in AFSs range from 0.29 to 15.21Mgha-1yr-1 aboveground, and 30 to 300MgCha-1 up to 1-m depth in the soil. Recent studies under various AFSs in diverse ecological conditions showed that tree-based agricultural systems, compared to treeless systems, stored more C in deeper soil layers near the tree than away from the tree; higher soil organic carbon content was associated with higher species richness and tree density; and C3 plants (trees) contributed to more C in the silt-+clay-sized (<53$\mu$m diameter) fractions-that constitute more stable C-than C4 plants in deeper soil profiles. The extent of C sequestered in AFSs depends to a great extent on environmental conditions and system management. Trading of the sequestered C is a viable opportunity for economic benefit to agroforestry practitioners, who are mostly resource-poor farmers in developing countries. However, more rigorous research results are required for AFSs to be used in global agendas of C sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Changing land use from agriculture to forestry affects global carbon (C) balances. In addition to reduce using fossil fuels, climatic benefits may be reached by increasing forested areas where appropriate. At present, there is limited data concerning whether differences in C sequestration rates occur among tree species. In this study we evaluated the effects of various species on C sequestration at an early stage of afforestation. Total C stocks, i.e. C in biomass, litter and soil, were compiled for hybrid aspen, poplar, silver birch, Norway spruce, larch and willow. The species were planted in random blocks on five sites at different latitudes. Soil, litter and plant biomass were sampled repeatedly, except for root biomass which was calculated from functions found in the literature. There were no differences between species in total C stocks after 8–9 years growth, except for short rotation coppice (SRC) willows that reached a high production early due to a higher stand density compared to the species managed with short rotation forestry (SRF). Total C sequestration rates for sites varied from zero to 2.3–4.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1. There were no effects of species on soil organic carbon (SOC), but significant decreases were noted for sites with high initial amounts, while SOC was unchanged or increased on sites with lower initial amounts. Mean SOC sequestration rates for sites ranged between −3.0 to 0.78 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Thus, former land use and time since abandonment rather than species seemed to influence the SOC pools at this early stage of afforestation. There were few differences between species in litter C in these young stands. We conclude that increased tree productivity had a positive effect on total C sequestration. It is crucial to include C in both biomass and soil when discussing C capture at land use change. The time factor is important and experiments like this should be followed for an extended time.},

Among these 2{\textperiodcentered}105 land use/cover observations selected for validation, a topsoil survey was conducted at about 10% of these sites. Topsoil sampling locations were selected as to be representative of European landscape using a Latin hypercube stratified random sampling, taking into account CORINE land cover 2000, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and its derived slope, aspect and curvature.In this study we will discuss how the LUCAS topsoil database can be used to map soil properties at continental scale over the geographical extent of Europe. Several soil properties were predicted using hybrid approaches like regression kriging. In this paper we describe the prediction of topsoil texture and related derived physical properties. Regression models were fitted using, along other variables, remotely sensed data coming from the MODIS sensor. The high temporal resolution of MODIS allowed detecting changes in the vegetative response due to soil properties, which can then be used to map soil features distribution. We will also discuss the prediction of intrinsically collinear variables like soil texture which required the use of models capable of dealing with multivariate constrained dependent variables like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).Cross validation of the fitted models proved that the LUCAS dataset constitutes a good sample for mapping purposes leading to cross-validation R2 between 0.47 and 0.50 for soil texture and normalized errors between 4 and 10%.},

abstract = {Most forests in Europe are patchily distributed within the agricultural landscape. Therefore, forest biogeochemistry in Europe cannot be understood without considering the connectivity of nutrient cycles between forest patches and fertilized cropland. In this paper, we quantified the role of roe deer, the most widespread wild ungulate in Europe, as a vector of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilized fields to forest patches, in a typical agricultural landscape of southwestern Europe. We derived a model of nutrient transfer from a data set on deer density, landscape-use by individual deer, and nutrient content in feces. The model shows that the magnitude of nutrient transfer is highly sensitive to the proportion of forest patches within the landscape, and to the way deer use the landscape to feed and defecate. Hence, the magnitude of nutrient transfer varies substantially across the landscape. Locally, deer may significantly fertilize the forest, transferring the equivalent of almost 20% of the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, and the equivalent of 0.13% of the total stock of phosphorus from cropland to forest patches each year. These inputs may markedly influence the biogeochemistry of forests in the long run, and the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio available to trees and forest plants. These results highlight the significant, but, heterogeneous, role of wild ungulates in forest biogeochemistry across Europe. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

We aimed to determine whether conclusions from recent studies could be generalized for other sites by monitoring the in situ soil respiration (Rs) by a portable soil-respiration system of 14 clear-cut experimental sites during the first 2 years after stump extraction and site preparation. The sites were established all over Sweden in 2013 and 2014 and were subjected to no disturbance (Control), patch scarification (PatchS), disc trenching (DiscT), and stump harvesting (StumpH). During year 1, Rs from sites treated with PatchS and StumpH were 11% and 13% lower than Rs from Control sites. DiscT-treated sites were apt to produce lower Rs than the Control (−9%, p =.09). In the second year, there were no significant differences in Rs between treatments, as no soil disturbance type occurring after stump harvest and site preparation had higher Rs than untreated, intact soil. Our results suggest that soil disturbances resulting from stump harvest and site preparation do not generally increase Rs and thus, from this perspective, provide support for the use of stumps for bioenergy.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, And ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {Plant litter and the microbial biomass are the major parent materials for soil organic matter (SOM) formation. Plant litter is composed of complex mixtures of organic components, mainly polysaccharides and lignin, but also aliphatic biopolymers and tannins. The composition and relative abundance of these components vary widely among plant species and tissue type. Whereas some components, such as lignin, are exclusively found in plant residues, specific products are formed by microorganisms, e.g. amino sugars. A wide variety of chemical methods is available for characterizing the chemical composition of these materials, especially the chemolytic methods, which determine individual degradation products and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, that gives an overview of the total organic chemical composition of the litter material. With the development of these techniques, an increasing number of studies are being carried out to investigate the changes during decay and the formation of humic substances. An overview is given on the amount of litter input, the proportion of various plant parts and their distribution (below-ground/above-ground), as well as the relative proportion of the different plant tissues. Major emphasis is on the organic chemical composition of the parent material for SOM formation and thus this paper provides information that will help to identify the changes occurring during biodegradation of plant litter in soils. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Root turnover is a critical component of ecosystem nutrient dynamics and carbon sequestration and is also an important sink for plant primary productivity. We tested global controls on root turnover across climatic gradients and for plant functional groups by using a database of 190 published studies. Root turnover rates increased exponentially with mean annual temperature for fine roots of grasslands (r2 = 0.48) and forests (r2 = 0.17) and for total root biomass in shrublands (r2 = 0.55). On the basis of the best-fit exponential model, the Q10 for root turnover was 1.4 for forest small diameter roots (5 mm or less), 1.6 for grassland fine roots, and 1.9 for shrublands. Surprisingly, after accounting for temperature, there was no such global relationship between precipitation and root turnover. The slowest average turnover rates were observed for entire tree root systems (10% annually), followed by 34% for shrubland total roots, 53% for grassland fine roots, 55% for wetland fine roots, and 56% for forest fine roots. Root turnover decreased from tropical to high-latitude systems for all plant functional groups. To test whether global relationships can be used to predict interannual variability in root turnover, we evaluated 14 yr of published root turnover data from a shortgrass steppe site in northeastern Colorado, USA. At this site there was no correlation between interannual variability in mean annual temperature and root turnover. Rather, turnover was positively correlated with the ratio of growing season precipitation and maximum monthly temperature (r2 = 0.61). We conclude that there are global patterns in rates of root turnover between plant groups and across climatic gradients but that these patterns cannot always be used for the successful prediction of the relationship of root turnover to climate change at a particular site.},

The mean age of the poplar was 20 years (range 4-73), the mean stand density 1327 stems ha -1 (range 155-4690), and the mean diameter at breast height (over bark) 210 mm (range 49-447 mm). Soil types in the poplar stands were mainly clay (25 stands), other sediments (six stands) and sandy-silty till (10 stands). The mean total standing dry weight above stump level (≈200 mm) for poplar was 141.9 ± 13.9 ton ha -1 with a range of 19-438 ton ha -1 . In addition to estimating conventional dry weights of trees and tree components, SLA, PLA and LAI, among other measures, were estimated and were in agreement with published figures. The results indicate that poplar stands could produce 70-105 ton ha -1 after 10-15 years growth mainly used for biofuel. Otherwise, the stands could be thinned for pulpwood and timber production with a rotation period of 25-30 years and the thinnings used for biofuel. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Swedish climate policy targets net zero greenhouse gases (GHG) by mid-century, with road transport independent of fossil fuels by 2030, requiring far-reaching changes in the way energy is used. Forest management is expected to support carbon sequestration and provide biomass for various uses, including energy. In this paper, we combine two energy scenarios with four forest scenarios and quantify GHG balances associated with energy-use for heat, electricity, and road transport, and with forest management and production, use, and end-of-life management of various forest products, including products for export. The aggregated GHG balances are evaluated in relation to the 2-degree target and an allocated Swedish CO2 budget. The production of biofuels in the agriculture sector is considered but not analyzed in detail. The results suggest that Swedish forestry can make an important contribution by supplying forest fuels and other products while maintaining or enhancing carbon storage in vegetation, soils, and forest products. The GHG neutrality goal is not met in any of the scenarios without factoring in carbon sequestration. Measures to enhance forest productivity can increase output of forest products (including biofuels for export) and also enhance carbon sequestration. The Swedish forest sector can let Sweden reach net negative emissions, and avoid “using up” its allocated CO2 budget, thereby increasing the associated emissions space for the rest of the world.},

abstract = {Increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content has been shown to increase soil fertility and carbon sequestration, but SOC changes are frequently neglected in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of crop production. This study used a novel LCA application using simulated SOC changes to examine the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of a combined food and energy crop production from a crop rotation perspective. On a case pig farm, introduction of one year of grass ley into a cereal-dominated crop rotation was simulated. The grass and pig manure were used for biogas production and the digestion residues were used as fertiliser on the farm. This crop rotation shift increased the SOC stocks by an estimated 27 and 49% after 50 years and at steady state, respectively. The estimated corresponding net wheat yield increase due to higher SOC was 8–16% and 16–32%, respectively, indicating that initial loss of low-yield oat production can be partly counterbalanced. Net SOC increase (corresponding to 2 t CO2-eq ha−1a−1) was the single most important variable affecting the GHG balance. When biogas replaced fossil fuels, GHG emissions of the combined energy-food crop rotation were approx. 3 t CO2-eq ha−1a−1lower than for the current food crop rotation. Sensitivity analyses led to variation of only 2–9% in the GHG balance. This study indicates that integrated food and energy crop production can improve SOC content and decrease GHG emissions from cropping systems. It also demonstrates the importance of including SOC changes in crop production-related LCA studies.},

abstract = {Previous research on the protection of soil organic C from decomposition suggests that soil texture affects soil C stocks. However, different pools of soil organic matter (SOM) might be differently related to soil texture. Our objective was to examine how soil texture differentially alters the distribution of organic C within physically and chemically defined pools of unprotected and protected SOM. We collected samples from two soil texture gradients where other variables influencing soil organic C content were held constant. One texture gradient (16-60% clay) was located near Stewart Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada and the other (25-50% clay) near Cygnet, OH. Soils were physically fractionated into coarse- and fine-particulate organic matter (POM), silt- and clay-sized particles within microaggregates, and easily dispersed silt- and clay-sized particles outside of microaggregates. Whole-soil organic C concentration was positively related to silt plus clay content at both sites. We found no relationship between soil texture and unprotected C (coarse- and fine-POM C). Biochemically protected C (nonhydrolyzable C) increased with increasing clay content in whole-soil samples, but the proportion of nonhydrolyzable C within silt- and clay-sized fractions was unchanged. As the amount of silt or clay increased, the amount of C stabilized within easily dispersed and microaggregate-associated silt or clay fractions decreased. Our results suggest that for a given level of C inputs, the relationship between mineral surface area and soil organic matter varies with soil texture for physically and biochemically protected C fractions. Because soil texture acts directly and indirectly on various protection mechanisms, it may not be a universal predictor of whole-soil C content.},

abstract = {Amazonian peatlands store a large amount of soil organic carbon (SOC), and its fate under a future changing climate is unknown. Here, we use a process-based peatland biogeochemistry model to quantify the carbon accumulation for peatland and nonpeatland ecosystems in the Pastaza-Mara{\~{n}}on foreland basin (PMFB) in the Peruvian Amazon from 12,000 y before present to AD 2100. Model simulations indicate that warming accelerates peat SOC loss, while increasing precipitation accelerates peat SOC accumulation at millennial time scales. The uncertain parameters and spatial variation of climate are significant sources of uncertainty to modeled peat carbon accumulation. Under warmer and presumably wetter conditions over the 21st century, SOC accumulation rate in the PMFB slows down to 7.9 (4.3–12.2) g{\textperiodcentered}C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}y−1 from the current rate of 16.1 (9.1–23.7) g{\textperiodcentered}C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}y−1, and the region may turn into a carbon source to the atmosphere at −53.3 (−66.8 to −41.2) g{\textperiodcentered}C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}y−1 (negative indicates source), depending on the level of warming. Peatland ecosystems show a higher vulnerability than nonpeatland ecosystems, as indicated by the ratio of their soil carbon density changes (ranging from 3.9 to 5.8). This is primarily due to larger peatlands carbon stocks and more dramatic responses of their aerobic and anaerobic decompositions in comparison with nonpeatland ecosystems under future climate conditions. Peatland and nonpeatland soils in the PMFB may lose up to 0.4 (0.32–0.52) Pg{\textperiodcentered}C by AD 2100 with the largest loss from palm swamp. The carbon-dense Amazonian peatland may switch from a current carbon sink into a source in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Current soil organic matter (SOM) models are empirical in nature by employing few conceptual SOM pools that have a specific turnover time, but that are not measurable and have no direct relationship with soil structural properties. Most soil particles are held together in aggregates and the number, size and stability of these aggregates significantly affect the size and amount of organic matter contained in these aggregates, and its susceptibility to decomposition. While it has been shown that soil aggregates and their dynamics can be measured directly in the laboratory and in the field, the impact of soil aggregate dynamics on SOM decomposition has not been explicitly incorporated in ecosystem models. Here, we present AggModel, a conceptual and simulation model that integrates soil aggregate and SOM dynamics. In AggModel, we consider unaggregated and microaggregated soil that can exist within or external to macroaggregated soil. Each of the four aggregate size classes contains particulate organic matter and mineral-associated organic matter fractions. We used published data from laboratory incubations to calibrate and validate the biological and environmental effects on the rate of formation and breakdown of macroaggregates and microaggregates, and the organic matter dynamics within these different aggregate fractions. After calibration, AggModel explained more than 60% of the variation in aggregate masses and over 70% of the variation in aggregate-associated carbon. The model estimated the turnover time of macroaggregates as 31 and 181 days for microaggregates. Sensitivity analysis of AggModel parameterization supported the notion that macroaggregate turnover rate has a strong control over microaggregate masses and, hence, carbon sequestration. In conclusion, AggModel successfully incorporates the explicit representation for the turnover of soil aggregates and their influence on SOM dynamics and can form the basis for new SOM modules within existing ecosystem models. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Using a new approach involving one-time measurements of radiocarbon (C-14) in fine (<2 min diameter) root tissues we have directly measured the mean age of fine-root carbon. We find that the carbon making up the standing stock of fine roots in deciduous and coniferous forests of the eastern United States has a mean age of 3-18 years for live fine roots, 10-18 years for dead fine roots, and 3-18 years for mixed live+dead fine roots. These C-14-derived mean ages represent the time C was stored in the plant before being allocated for root growth, plus the average lifespan (for live roots), plus the average time for the root to decompose (for dead roots and mixtures). Comparison of the C-14 content of roots known to have grown within I year with the C-14 of atmospheric CO2 for the same period shows that root tissues are derived from recently fixed carbon, and the storage time prior to allocation is <2 years and likely <1 year. Fine-root mean ages tend to increase with depth in the soil. Live roots in the organic horizons are made of C fixed 3-8 years ago compared with 11-18 years in the mineral B horizons. The mean age of C in roots increases with root diameter and also is related to branching order. Our results differ dramatically from previous estimates of fine-root mean ages made using mass balance approaches and root-viewing cameras, which generally report life spans (mean ages for live roots) of a few months to 1-2 years. Each method for estimating fine-root dynamics, including this new radiocarbon method, has biases. Root-viewing approaches tend to emphasize more rapidly cycling roots, while radiocarbon ages tend to reflect those components that persist longest in the soil. Our C-14-derived estimates of long mean ages can be reconciled with faster estimates only if fine-root populations have varying rates of root mortality and decomposition. Our results indicate that it standard definition of fine roots, as those with diameters of <2 mm, is inadequate to determine the most dynamic portion of the root population. Recognition of the variability in fine-root dynamics is necessary to obtain better estimates of belowground C inputs.},

abstract = {Carbon isotopic fractionations in plant materials and those occurring during decomposition have direct implications in studies of short-and longer-term soil organic matter dynamics. Thus the products of decomposition, the evolved CO(2) and the newly formed soil organic matter, may vary in their (13)C signature from that of the original plant material. To evaluate the importance of such fractionation processes, the variations in (13)C signatures between and within plant parts of a tropical grass (Brachiaria humidicola) and tropical legume (Desmodium ovalifolium) were measured and the changes in (13)C content (signatures) during decomposition were monitored over a period of four months. As expected the grass materials were less depleted in (13)C (-11.4 to -11.9 per thousand) than those of the legume (-27.3 to -25.8 per thousand). Root materials of the legume were less (1.5 per thousand) depleted in (13)C compared with the leaves. Plant lignin-C was strongly depleted in (13)C compared with the bulk material by up to 2.5 per thousand in the legume and up to 4.7 per thousand in the grass. Plant materials were subsequently incubated in a sand/nutrient-solution/microbial inoculum mixture. The respiration product CO(2) was trapped in NaOH and precipitated as CaCO(3), suitable for analysis using an automated C/N analyser coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Significant depletion in (13)C of the evolved CO(2) was observed during the initial stages of decomposition probably as a result of microbial fractionation as it was not associated with the (13)C signatures of the measured more decomposable fractions (non-acid detergent fibre and cellulose). While the cumulative CO(2)-(13)C signatures of legume materials became slightly enriched with ongoing decomposition, the CO(2)-C of the grass materials remained depleted in (13)C. Associated isotopic fractionation correction factors for source identification of CO(2-)C varied with time and suggested errors of 2-19% in the estimation of the plant-derived C at 119 days of incubation in a soil of an intermediate (-20.0 per thousand) (13)C signature. Analysis of the residual material after 119 days of incubation showed little or no change in the (13)C signature partly due to the incomplete decomposition at the time of harvesting.

In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.},

abstract = {Uneven-aged forest management is suggested to be a sustainable management alternative in boreal forests, but knowledge on applicable harvest intensities is very limited as majority of the studies has focused on even-aged management practices. The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10–30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8–16 m2 ha−1). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m−2 a−1 of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5–20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m3 ha−1 for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5–7 m3 ha−1 a−1) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80–120 m3 ha−1 was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40–60 m3 ha−1. The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices.},

abstract = {The ultimate aim of scientific research is to understand the natural world. In order to achieve this goal, Western science has relied on different cognitive strategies, including simplification, both in terms of analysis and explanation. As the British natural philosopher Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727) put it, “Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.” In a way, examples of simplification include using idealized models, such as a ‘perfect sphere rolling down a smooth plane in a vacuum'; conducting experiments in a strictly controlled environment such as the laboratory; analysing complex systems by reducing them to their individual parts; and generally by using a linear and deterministic concept of how the world, including life, works. The French philosopher and mathematician Ren{\'{e}} Descartes (1596–1650) was the first to introduce reductionism to Western thinking and philosophy. According to his view, the world can be regarded as a clockwork mechanism; to understand it, one need only investigate the parts and then reassemble each component to recreate the whole. Descartes' work was expanded by Newton (1643–1727) and ultimately culminated in the Principia Mathematica in 1687—one of the most influential science books ever written—in which Newton further advanced the idea of a ‘clockwork universe'. Since the time of Newton, classical mechanics has been regarded as the foundation of scientific research. Scientists, including biologists, have adopted the Newtonian approach both at the ontological level—in terms of their conception of the world and the things of which it is made—and the epistemological level—in terms of their approach to understanding those things. The Newtonian epistemology, in fact, states that scientific knowledge has to provide an objective representation of the external world. The world's apparent complexity can be resolved by analysis and reducing phenomena to their simplest components. “Once you {\ldots}},

abstract = {Natural disturbances are among the most important factors that shape forest dynamics and forest landscapes. However, the natural disturbance regime of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests in Europe is not well understood. We studied the disturbance regimes in three forest reserves in Bulgaria (Parangalitsa, Bistrishko branishte, and Beglika), which are representative of the range of conditions typical for P. abies ecosystems in central and southern Europe. Our data indicated that large-scale disturbances were most numerous in forests that were between 120 and 160 years old, those with unimodal diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions, and especially those located in vulnerable topographic settings. Wind disturbances ranged up to 60 ha, followed in one case by a 200 ha Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758) outbreak. Older forests and those with more complex structures (i.e., reverse-J DBH) were characterized by numerous small gaps but were also affected by a few larger disturbances. In some old-growth forests at highly productive sites, gaps could be so numerous that the long-term existence of old trees may become an exception. Over the past centuries, the natural range of variability of these Norway spruce forests in Bulgaria appears to have been shaped mostly by wind and bark beetle disturbances of various sizes.},

abstract = {Termites are a highly uncertain component in the global source budgets of CH(4) and CO(2). Large seasonal variations in termite mound fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2) have been reported in tropical savannas but the reason for this is largely unknown. This paper investigated the processes that govern these seasonal variations in CH(4) and CO(2) fluxes from the mounds of Microcerotermes nervosus Hill (Termitidae), a common termite species in Australian tropical savannas. Fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2) of termite mounds were 3.5-fold greater in the wet season as compared to the dry season and were a direct function of termite biomass. Termite biomass in mound samples was tenfold greater in the wet season compared to the dry season. When expressed per unit termite biomass, termite fluxes were only 1.2 (CH(4)) and 1.4 (CO(2))-fold greater in the wet season as compared to the dry season and could not explain the large seasonal variations in mound fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2). Seasonal variation in both gas diffusivity through mound walls and CH(4) oxidation by mound material was negligible. These results highlight for the first time that seasonal termite population dynamics are the main driver for the observed seasonal differences in mound fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2). These findings highlight the need to combine measurements of gas fluxes from termite mounds with detailed studies of termite population dynamics to reduce the uncertainty in quantifying seasonal variations in termite mound fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2).},

abstract = {Under the current accounting systems, emissions produced when biomass is burnt for energy are accounted as zero, resulting in what is referred to as the 'carbon neutrality' assumption. However, if current harvest levels are increased to produce more bioenergy, carbon that would have been stored in the biosphere might be instead released in the atmosphere. This study utilizes a comparative approach that considers emissions under alternative energy supply options. This approach shows that the emission benefits of bioenergy compared to use of fossil fuel are time-dependent. It emerges that the assumption that bioenergy always results in zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to use of fossil fuels can be misleading, particularly in the context of short-to-medium term goals. While it is clear that all sources of woody bioenergy from sustainably managed forests will produce emission reductions in the long term, different woody biomass sources have various impacts in the short-medium term. The study shows that the use of forest residues that are easily decomposable can produce GHG benefits compared to use of fossil fuels from the beginning of their use and that biomass from dedicated plantations established on marginal land can be carbon neutral from the beginning of its use. However, the risk of short-to-medium term negative impacts is high when additional fellings are extracted to produce bioenergy and the proportion of felled biomass used for bioenergy is low, or when land with high C stocks is converted to low productivity bioenergy plantations. The method used in the study provides an instrument to identify the time-dependent pattern of emission reductions for alternative bioenergy sources. In this way, decision makers can evaluate which bioenergy options are most beneficial for meeting short-term GHG emission reduction goals and which ones are more appropriate for medium to longer term objectives. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The ratio of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) to total organic carbon (Corg) was measured in soils from long-term agricultural experiments located in the temperate climatic zone of Central Europe. One hundred and thirty-four plots located in 26 experimental sites were analysed. This survey of Cmic-to-Corg ratios indicated no universal equilibrium constant. In contrast, a comparative regression analysis of permanent monoculture plots (M) with continuous crop rotation plots (R) showed both to be highly significantly different at the P = 0.001 level: the regression line of continuous crop rotations shows a steeper slope, suggesting that a higher concentration of microbial carbon is characteristic of the crop rotation. The regressions accounted for 87% (M) and 94% (R) of the variances in the data, respectively. Mean % Cmic in Corg amounted to 2.3 for permanent monocultures and to 2.9 for continuous crop rotations, respectively, of the simplest, the mineral fertilizer management. The differences in C-to-C ratios between the two management systems is thought to be caused by the difference in cropping management rather than by soil texture, i.e. clay content. These Cmic-to-Corg ratios rose to 4 or 3.7% in both plots under monoculture and plots under rotation, when the plots had received organic fertilizer the year prior to sampling. This rise in Cmic over Corg is seen as a transient rather than an absolute phenomenon and is believed to be due to the easily available carbon fraction of the introduced organic materia. Linearity of the Cmic-to-Corg relationship seems to be expressed only up to 2.5% Corg. Regressions of Cmic-to-Nt were as well highly significant (P =0.001) and in addition, the comparative regression analysis between M and R plots.},

@article{Hsiao2000,
abstract = {Water transport is an integral part of the process of growth by cell expansion and accounts for most of the increase in cell volume characterizing growth. Under water deficiency, growth is readily inhibited and growth of roots is favoured over that of leaves. The mechanisms underlying this differential response are examined in terms of Lockhart's equations and water transport. For roots, when water potential (psi) is suddenly reduced, osmotic adjustment occurs rapidly to allow partial turgor recovery and re-establishment of psi gradient for water uptake, and the loosening ability of the cell wall increases as indicated by a rapid decline in yield-threshold turgor. These adjustments permit roots to resume growth under low psi. In contrast, in leaves under reductions in psi of similar magnitude, osmotic adjustment occurs slowly and wall loosening ability either does not increase substantially or actually decreases, leading to marked growth inhibition. The growth region of both roots and leaves are hydraulically isolated from the vascular system. This isolation protects the root from low psi in the mature xylem and facilitates the continued growth into new moist soil volume. Simulations with a leaky cable model that includes a sink term for growth water uptake show that growth zone psi is barely affected by soil water removal through transpiration. On the other hand, hydraulic isolation dictates that psi of the leaf growth region would be low and subjected to further reduction by high evaporative demand. Thus, a combination of transport and changes in growth parameters is proposed as the mechanism co-ordinating the growth of the two organs under conditions of soil moisture depletion. The model simulation also showed that roots behave as reversibly leaky cable in water uptake. Some field data on root water extraction and vertical profiles of psi in shoots are viewed as manifestations of these basic phenomena. Also discussed is the trade-off between high xylem conductance and strong osmotic adjustment.},

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks to global warming are major uncertainties in climate models. For in-depth understanding of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) after soil warming, long-term responses of SOC stabilization mechanisms such as aggregation, organo-mineral interactions and chemical recalcitrance need to be addressed. This study investigated the effect of 6 years of geothermal soil warming on different SOC fractions in an unmanaged grassland in Iceland. Along an extreme warming gradient of +0 to $\sim$+40 °C, we isolated five fractions of SOC that varied conceptually in turnover rate from active to passive in the following order: particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), SOC in sand and stable aggregates (SA), SOC in silt and clay (SC-rSOC) and resistant SOC (rSOC). Soil warming of 0.6 °C increased bulk SOC by 22 ± 43% (0–10 cm soil layer) and 27 ± 54% (20–30 cm), while further warming led to exponential SOC depletion of up to 79 ± 14% (0–10 cm) and 74 ± 8% (20–30) in the most warmed plots ($\sim$+40 °C). Only the SA fraction was more sensitive than the bulk soil, with 93 ± 6% (0–10 cm) and 86 ± 13% (20–30 cm) SOC losses and the highest relative enrichment in 13C as an indicator for the degree of decomposition (+1.6 ± 1.5‰ in 0–10 cm and +1.3 ± 0.8‰ in 20–30 cm). The SA fraction mass also declined along the warming gradient, while the SC fraction mass increased. This was explained by deactivation of aggregate-binding mechanisms. There was no difference between the responses of SC-rSOC (slow-cycling) and rSOC (passive) to warming, and 13C enrichment in rSOC was equal to that in bulk soil. We concluded that the sensitivity of SOC to warming was not a function of age or chemical recalcitrance, but triggered by changes in biophysical stabilization mechanisms, such as aggregation.},

abstract = {A key challenge for wildlife management is to handle competing goals. High ungulate densities may be desirable from hunting and recreational perspectives, but may come in conflict with needs to limit or reduce browsing damage. Since browsing intensity is negatively related to forage availability it may be possible to mitigate damage on forest by increasing forage availability within the landscape. A commonly used method to increase the attractiveness of a localized part of the landscape is to establish food plots. In a multiyear setup using enclosures, wildlife observations, field surveys, and controlled biomass removal, we studied food plots to document forage production, utilization by ungulates, and browsing on adjacent forests in southern Sweden. The fenced parts of the food plots produced on average 2230 to 5810 kg ha?1 marrow-stem kale, second-year clover mix or early-sown rapeseed. The biomass of target crops was generally higher within ungrazed (exclosures) compared to grazed (controls) quadrats on the food plots, which demonstrates that the crops were used as forage by ungulates. Browsing on deciduous trees in the adjacent forest was higher within 70–135 m from the food plots compared to areas further away. For wildlife management, our study shows that establishment of food plots provides substantial amounts of forage both during growing season and at the onset of the dormant season, and that a large share of this food is consumed. Finally, our study documents that forage availability for ungulates at the onset of the often- limiting dormant season can be increased by fencing food plots throughout the growing season.},

abstract = {Microbial catabolic diversity can be reduced by intensive land-uses, which may have implications for the resistance of the soils to stress or disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that the microbial community in a soil where catabolic diversity has been reduced by cropping is less resistant to increasing stress or disturbance compared with a matched soil under pasture, where catabolic diversity was high. Increasing stress was imposed by reducing pH, increasing salinity (imposed by increasing soil electrical conductivity; EC) or increasing heavy metal contamination in the soils. Disturbance was simulated by a series of wet - dry or freeze - thaw cycles. After incubation of the soils under these regimes, catabolic evenness (a component of microbial functional diversity defined as the uniformity of substrate use) was calculated from catabolic response profiles. These profiles were determined by adding a range of simple C substrates to the soils and measuring short-term respiration responses. Stress or disturbance caused much greater changes in catabolic evenness in the crop soil (low catabolic evenness) than the pasture soil (high catabolic evenness). Increasing Cu or salt stress caused increases in catabolic evenness at low intensities in both soils, but, in the crop soil, greater stress caused greater declines in catabolic evenness. Declines in pH also caused much greater decreases in catabolic evenness in the crop than the pasture soil. Catabolic evenness initially increased with increasing numbers of wet - dry or freeze - thaw cycles, but after four cycles, evenness declined in both soils. These changes in evenness could be attributed to significant changes (P < 0.05) in most catabolic responses. In contrast, there were generally few changes in microbial biomass C as a result of stress or disturbance treatments. Except for EC stress, all treatments caused slight increases in biomass C at low levels (only significant in the pH and Cu treatments) that subsequently diminished at the highest stress or disturbance levels. Microbial catabolic diversity generally followed the classical 'hump-back' responses of diversity to increasing stress or disturbance. We concluded that reduction in catabolic diversity and changes in soil properties due to land use could reduce the resistance of microbial communities to stress or disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon (C)-climate feedbacks depend strongly on how soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition responds to temperature. This dependency is often represented in land models by the parameter Q10, which quantifies the relative increase of microbial soil respiration per 10 °C temperature increase. Many studies have conducted paired laboratory soil incubations and inferred “active” and “slow” pool Q10 values by fitting linear two-pool models to measured respiration time series. Using a recently published incubation study (Qin et al. in Sci Adv 5(7):eaau1218, 2019) as an example, here we first show that the very high parametric equifinality of the linear two-pool models may render such incubation-based Q10 estimates unreliable. In particular, we show that, accompanied by the uncertain initial active pool size, the slow pool Q10 can span a very wide range, including values as high as 100, although all parameter combinations are producing almost equally good model fit with respect to the observations. This result is robust whether or not interactions between the active and slow pools are considered (typically these interactions are not considered when interpreting incubation data, but are part of the predictive soil carbon models). This very large parametric equifinality in the context of interpreting incubation data is consistent with the poor temporal extrapolation capability of linear multi-pool models identified in recent studies. Next, using a microbe-explicit SOM model (RESOM), we show that the inferred two pools and their associated parameters (e.g., Q10) could be artificial constructs and are therefore unreliable concepts for integration into predictive models. We finally discuss uncertainties in applying linear two-pool (or more generally multiple-pool) models to estimate SOM decomposition parameters such as temperature sensitivities from laboratory incubations. We also propose new observations and model structures that could enable better process understanding and more robust predictive capabilities of soil carbon dynamics.},

abstract = {A number of nonlinear models have recently been proposed for simulating soil carbon decomposition. Their predictions of soil carbon responses to fresh litter input and warming differ significantly from conventional linear models. Using both stability analysis and numerical simulations, we showed that two of those nonlinear models (a two-pool model and a three-pool model) exhibit damped oscillatory responses to small perturbations. Stability analysis showed the frequency of oscillation is proportional to √(&varepsilon;−1−1) Ks/Vs in the two-pool model, and to √(&varepsilon;−1−1) Kl/Vl in the three-pool model, where &varepsilon; is microbial growth efficiency, Ks and Kl are the half saturation constants of soil and litter carbon, respectively, and /Vs and /Vl are the maximal rates of carbon decomposition per unit of microbial biomass for soil and litter carbon, respectively. For both models, the oscillation has a period of between 5 and 15 years depending on other parameter values, and has smaller amplitude at soil temperatures between 0 and 15 °C. In addition, the equilibrium pool sizes of litter or soil carbon are insensitive to carbon inputs in the nonlinear model, but are proportional to carbon input in the conventional linear model. Under warming, the microbial biomass and litter carbon pools simulated by the nonlinear models can increase or decrease, depending whether &varepsilon; varies with temperature. In contrast, the conventional linear models always simulate a decrease in both microbial and litter carbon pools with warming. Based on the evidence available, we concluded that the oscillatory behavior and insensitivity of soil carbon to carbon input are notable features in these nonlinear models that are somewhat unrealistic. We recommend that a better model for capturing the soil carbon dynamics over decadal to centennial timescales would combine the sensitivity of the conventional models to carbon influx with the flexible response to warming of the nonlinear model.},

abstract = {Dead wood creation is an important tool for restoring the natural characteristics of boreal managed forests, where the amount of dead wood has seriously declined as a result of forest management practices. Although many forest species would benefit from restoration, foresters are concerned about the increased risk of bark beetle attacks on surrounding managed forests. In our study, we investigated whether the number or size of dead wood created affects the number of bark beetles (Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus) colonizing the felled trees and whether the amount of dead wood and burning treatment after colonization has an effect on I. typographus breeding success and consequential tree deaths in forest borders surrounding restoration areas. The experimental restoration of Norway spruce dominated stands included partial cuttings with three levels of down wood retention (DWR) (5, 30, and 60 m3 ha-1) and a burn/non-burn treatment (3 × 2 factorial) with three replicates of each treatment combination. An increase in the total number of down wood retention spruces (DWRS) decreased the proportion of trees colonized by I. typographus, but increased the total number of colonized trees. P. chalcographus colonized almost 100% of felled spruces. The total number of I. typographus egg galleries was best explained by the interaction of the number and mean diameter of DWRS. According to the models constructed the experimental areas with great numbers of large spruces harbor the most I. typographus egg galleries, while stands with the same number of smaller trees almost totally lack egg galleries. The number of P. chalcographus mating chambers increased along with an increase in the number of DWRS. Burning treatment diminished the breeding success of I. typographus, especially at the highest DWR level, where the intensity of fire was also the highest. Instead of relatively extensive colonization by I. typographus and P. chalcographus, numbers of tree deaths at forest edges surrounding restoration areas were overall very low, and therefore no significant predictors were found. This study shows that the number and size of damaged trees affects the number of bark beetles colonizing the restoration area. However, in Finland the risks of restoration projects of this magnitude, at least when I. typographus populations are at endemic levels, are rather low. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

After acid pretreatment, the order changed to spruce (170 g kg−1) < aspen (290 g kg−1), birch (290 g kg−1). The relatively high recalcitrance of untreated birch was not possible to relate to mass fraction of lignin, S:G ratio, cellulose crystallinity, or mass fraction of acetyl, but rather to structural features, such as a more compact surface structure with high density and low cellulose accessibility. The relatively high sugar yields from both untreated and pretreated aspen suggest that aspen wood is well suited as feedstock for production of liquid biofuels and green chemicals in forest-based biorefineries.},

Specifically, we take a symbolic interactionism-based identity theory perspective and examine qualitative data from 73 corporate expatriates in China and Japan, revealing an expatriate identity (i.e., identification with being a manager and a foreigner), and a cultural identity (i.e., identification with home and host country cultures) which through identity stability/change are related to the mode and degree of expatriate work and non-work adjustment. Our findings suggest that these identities explain how corporate expatriates shape their new environment to their preferences, instead of adjusting to it.},

abstract = {Climatic, atmospheric, and land-use changes all have the potential to alter soil microbial activity, mediated by changes in plant inputs. Many microbial models of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition have been proposed recently to advance prediction of climate and carbon (C) feedbacks. Most of these models, however, exhibit unrealistic oscillatory behavior and SOC insensitivity to long-term changes in C inputs. Here we diagnose the source of these problems in four archetypal models and propose a density-dependent formulation of microbial turnover, motivated by community-level interactions, that limits population sizes and reduces oscillations. We compare model predictions to 24 long-term C-input field manipulations and identify key benchmarks. The proposed formulation reproduces soil C responses to long-term C-input changes and implies greater SOC storage associated with CO2-fertilization-driven increases in C inputs over the coming century compared to recent microbial models. This study provides a simple modification to improve microbial models for inclusion in Earth System Models.},

abstract = {Assessments of management-induced changes in soil organic matter depend on the methods used to calculate the quantities of organic C and N stored in soils. Chemical analyses in the laboratory indicate the concentrations of elements in soils, but the thickness and bulk density of the soil layers in the fieid must be considered to estimate the quantities of elements per unit area. Conventional methods that calculate organic matter storage as the product of concentration, bulk density and thickness do not fully account for variations in soil mass. Comparisons between the quantities of organic C, N, P and S in Gray Luvisol soils under native aspen forest and various cropping systems were hampered by differences in the mass of soil under consideration. The influence of these differences was eliminated by calculating the masses of C, N, P and S in an "equivalent soil mass" (i.e. the mass of soil in a standard or reference surface layer). Reassessment of previously published data also indicated that estimates of organic matter storage depended on soil mass. Appraisals of organic matter depletion or accumulation usually were different for cimparisons among element masses in an equivalent soil mass than for comparisons among element masses in genetic horizons or in fixed sampling depths. Unless soil erosion or deposition had altered the mass of topsoil per unit area, comparisons among unequal soil masses were unjustified and erroneous. For management-induced changes in soil organic matter and nutrient storage to be assessed reliably, the masses of soil being compared must be equivalent.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in the profile may constitute an important factor for soil carbon cycling. However, the formation of the SOM profile is currently poorly understood due to equifinality, caused by the entanglement of several processes: input from roots, mixing due to bioturbation, and organic matter leaching. In this study we quantified the contribution of these three processes using Bayesian parameter estimation for the mechanistic SOM profile model SOMPROF. Based on organic carbon measurements, 13 parameters related to decomposition and transport of organic matter were estimated for two temperate forest soils: an Arenosol with a mor humus form (Loobos, the Netherlands), and a Cambisol with mull-type humus (Hainich, Germany). Furthermore, the use of the radioisotope Pb-210(ex) as tracer for vertical SOM transport was studied. For Loobos, the calibration results demonstrate the importance of organic matter transport with the liquid phase for shaping the vertical SOM profile, while the effects of bioturbation are generally negligible. These results are in good agreement with expectations given in situ conditions. For Hainich, the calibration offered three distinct explanations for the observations (three modes in the posterior distribution). With the addition of Pb-210(ex) data and prior knowledge, as well as additional information about in situ conditions, we were able to identify the most likely explanation, which indicated that root litter input is a dominant process for the SOM profile. For both sites the organic matter appears to comprise mainly adsorbed but potentially leachable material, pointing to the importance of organo-mineral interactions. Furthermore, organic matter in the mineral soil appears to be mainly derived from root litter, supporting previous studies that highlighted the importance of root input for soil carbon sequestration. The Pb-210(ex) measurements added only slight additional constraint on the estimated parameters. However, with sufficient replicate measurements and possibly in combination with other tracers, this isotope may still hold value as tracer for SOM transport.},

abstract = {The carbon (C) dynamics of tropical peatlands can be of global importance, because, particularly in Southeast Asia, they are the source of considerable amounts of C released to the atmosphere as a result of land-use change and fire. In contrast, the existence of tropical peatlands in Amazonia has been documented only recently. According to a recent study, the 120 000 km2 subsiding Pastaza-Maran ˜o ´n foreland basin in Peruvian Amazonia harbours previously unstudied and up to 7.5 m thick peat deposits. We studied the role of these peat deposits as a C reserve and sink by measuring peat depth, radiocarbon age and peat and C accumulation rates at 5–13 sites. The basal ages varied from 1975 to 8870 cal yr BP, peat accumulation rates from 0.46 to 9.31 mm yr1 and C accumulation rates from 28 to 108 g m2 yr1. The total peatland area and current peat C stock within the area of two studied satellite images were 21 929 km2 and 3.116 Gt (with a range of 0.837–9.461 Gt). The C stock is 32% (with a range of 8.7–98%) of the best estimate of the South American tropical peatland C stock and 3.5% (with a range of 0.9–10.7%) of the best estimate of the global tropical peatland C stock. The whole Pastaza-Maran ˜o ´n basin probably supports about twice this peatland area and peat C stock. In addition to their contemporary geographical extent, these peatlands probably also have a large historical (vertical) extension because of their location in a foreland basin characterized by extensive river sedi- mentation, peat burial and subsidence for most of the Quaternary period. Burial of peat layers in deposits of up to 1 km thick Quaternary river sediments removes C from the short-term C cycle between the biosphere and atmo- sphere, generating a long-term C sink.},

abstract = {Trait-based models are an emerging tool in ecology with the potential to link community dynamics, environmental responses and ecosystem processes. These models represent complex communities by defining taxa with trait combinations derived from prior distributions that may be constrained by trade-offs. Herein I develop a model that links microbial community composition with physiological and enzymatic traits to predict litter decomposition rates. This approach allows for trade-offs among traits that represent alternative microbial strategies for resource acquisition. The model predicts that optimal strategies depend on the level of enzyme production in the whole community, which determines resource availability and decomposition rates. There is also evidence for facilitation and competition among microbial taxa that co-occur on decomposing litter. These interactions vary with community investment in extracellular enzyme production and the magnitude of trade-offs affecting enzyme biochemical traits. The model accounted for 69% of the variation in decomposition rates of 15 Hawaiian litter types and up to 26% of the variation in enzyme activities. By explicitly representing diversity, trait-based models can predict ecosystem processes based on functional trait distributions in a community. The model developed herein illustrates that traits influencing microbial enzyme production are some of the key controls on litter decomposition rates.},

Soil organic carbon sequestration potential for Canadian agricultural ecoregions calculated using the Introductory Carbon Balance Model. Call. J. Soil Sci. 88: 451-460. The potential for storage of atmospheric CO2-C as soil organic C (SOC) in agroecosystems depends largely oil soil biological activity and the quantity and quality of annual C inputs to Soil. In this Study we used the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) approach driven by daily standard weather station data, specific soil properties and crop characteristics at the scale of Canadian agricultural ecoregions. The objectives were to calculate a climate-dependent soil biological activity parameter representative for annual agricultural crop production systems (r(e_crop)) and to estimate the effect of fallow (r(e_fallow)). These parameters are based on the daily product of soil temperature and stored water that influence biological activity in the arable layer, and are used to adjust the decomposition rates of the ICBM SOC pools. We also tested r(e_crop) and r(e_fallow) on SOC stock change data for different site and treatment combinations from long-term field experiments located in some of the ecoregions. An r(e_crop) value of 0.95 for western ecoregions was on average 0.23 units lower than that of the eastern ecoregions, indicating a lower decomposition rate of SOC. Although the estimated annual C inputs to soil for small-grain cereals were on average approximate to 7.5% higher in the eastern ecoregions (305 vs. 285 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), the overall results suggest that the western ecoregions would have a greater potential to maintain high SOC levels in the long term. However, these parameters varied between ecoregions and, consequently, the SOC sequestration potential was not always higher for the western ecoregions. The effect of fallow was on average approximate to 0.04, i.e., SOC decomposed slightly faster under fallow. Predictions for 24 out of 33 site and treatment combinations across Canada were significantly improved (P=0.003), compared with a previous application with the ICBM that did not differentiate between crops and fallow. The methodology used here enabled us to examine regional differences in the potential for SOC sequestration as a balance between annual C inputs to soil and soil biological activity.},

abstract = {Abstract Up-to-date and accurate information of ecosystem state and functioning becomes ever more critical for decision-making and policy. For complex ecosystems such as forests, these demands can in some cases not be met by field observations only, especially at larger scales. Additionally, methodological requirements include comparability and transparency. To satisfy these needs, models can provide an important supplement or alternative.  We examined the validity of the litter decomposition and soil carbon model Yasso07 in Swiss forests based on data on observed decomposition of (i) foliage and fine root litter from sites along a climatic and altitudinal gradient and (ii) of 588 dead trees from 394 plots of the Swiss National Forest Inventory. Our objectives were to (i) examine the effect of the application of three different published Yasso07 parameter sets on simulated decay rate; (ii) analyze the accuracy of Yasso07 for reproducing observed decomposition of litter and dead wood in Swiss forests; and (iii) evaluate the suitability of Yasso07 for regional and national scale applications in Swiss forests.  From the three examined parameter sets, the set was identified which resulted in the best agreement between Yasso07 results and observed decomposition. No significant differences were found between simulated and observed remaining C in foliage and fine root litter after 10 years and in lying dead trees after 14–21 years. The model overestimated the decomposition of standing dead trees. We concluded that Yasso07 can provide accurate information on temporal changes in C stocks in litter and deadwood in Swiss forests in a transparent manner that is valid for, e.g., reporting purposes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.},

abstract = {The Green Revolution boosted crop yields in developing nations by introducing dwarf genotypes of wheat and rice capable of responding to fertilisation without lodging. We now need a second Green Revolution, to improve the yield of crops grown in infertile soils by farmers with little access to fertiliser, who represent the majority of thirdworld farmers. Just as the Green Revolution was based on crops responsive to high soil fertility, the second Green Revolution will be based on crops tolerant of low soil fertility. Substantial genetic variation in the productivity of crops in infertile soil has been known for over a century. In recent years we have developed a better understanding of the traits responsible for this variation. Root architecture is critically important by determining soil exploration and therefore nutrient acquisition. Architectural traits under genetic control include basal-root gravitropism, adventitious-root formation and lateral branching. Architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging are important for acquisition of phosphorus from infertile soils. Genetic variation in the length and density of root hairs is important for the acquisition of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Genetic variation in root cortical aerenchyma formation and secondary development ('root etiolation') are important in reducing the metabolic costs of root growth and soil exploration. Genetic variation in rhizosphere modification through the efflux of protons, organic acids and enzymes is important for the mobilisation of nutrients such as phosphorus and transition metals, and the avoidance of aluminum toxicity. Manipulation of ion transporters may be useful for improving the acquisition of nitrate and for enhancing salt tolerance. With the noteworthy exceptions of rhizosphere modi. cation and ion transporters, most of these traits are under complex genetic control. Genetic variation in these traits is associated with substantial yield gains in low-fertility soils, as illustrated by the case of phosphorus efficiency in bean and soybean. In breeding crops for low-fertility soils, selection for specifi. c root traits through direct phenotypic evaluation or molecular markers is likely to be more productive than conventional field screening. Crop genotypes with greater yield in infertile soils will substantially improve the productivity and sustainability of low-input agroecosystems, and in high-input agroecosystems will reduce the environmental impacts of intensive fertilisation. Although the development of crops with reduced fertiliser requirements has been successful in the few cases it has been attempted, the global scientific effort devoted to this enterprise is small, especially considering the magnitude of the humanitarian, environmental and economic bene. ts being forgone. Population growth, ongoing soil degradation and increasing costs of chemical fertiliser will make the second Green Revolution a priority for plant biology in the 21st century.},

The design of the laser sensor is reported as well as its performances in terms of precision error and field deployment capabilities. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of QCLAS and its suitability for gas emission monitoring and for the determination of fluxes, we report the results from a field campaign, that took place in the Wallis and Futuna Islands in 2011, to investigate the impact of environmental intensive pig farming.},

abstract = {During growth, several cereals store significant amounts of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which have important prebiotic properties. Cereal forage crops are also essential components of many Mediterranean agricultural systems, although little information is available on their dynamics of accumulation and partitioning of dry matter and FOS during growth. Oat ( Avena sativa L., cv . ‘Flavia' and cv . ‘Genziana'), emmer wheat ( Triticum dicoccum Schrank, cv . ‘Giovanni Paolo'), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L., cv . ‘Diomede') and triticale ( xTriticosecale Wittmack, cv . ‘Rigel') were investigated for their synthesis of FOS, with a view to development of management approaches for harvesting high-quality forage, and to determine whether these species can be used as natural sources of FOS for commercial use. The study was conducted at Foggia (Italy) and Bella (Potenza, Italy) over two growing seasons (2008–2009; 2009–2010). Dry-matter accumulation and FOS contents were determined for plant fractions from heading to kernel-hard stages. There were large variations across these species for dry-matter partitioning and dry-matter yield (greatest for triticale: 1.24 kg m −2 ), and for FOS levels of total plants and plant fractions. Emmer wheat and triticale showed greater FOS production (52.0, 41.1 g m −2 , respectively). Barley, emmer wheat and triticale showed higher FOS levels in total plants (4.11%, 5.93%, 4.33% dry matter, respectively). Barley, emmer wheat and triticale appear to be the most interesting species for production of forage biomass rich in FOS and as natural FOS sources for industrial use.},

Yet it remains largely unknown why some SOM persists for millennia whereas other SOM decomposes readily--and this limits our ability to predict how soils will respond to climate change. Recent analytical and experimental advances have demonstrated that molecular structure alone does not control SOM stability: in fact, environmental and biological controls predominate. Here we propose ways to include this understanding in a new generation of experiments and soil carbon models, thereby improving predictions of the SOM response to global warming.},

abstract = {In order to better understand the development and maintenance of feeding selectivity, several feeding experiments were performed with fallow deer (Dama dama L.). In experiments performed when the fawns were between ten and 27 days old, it was found that all fawns showed preferences for sucrose but aversions towards tannic acid and ascorbic acid. However, differences in selectivity towards tannic acid were present already before the fawns became functional ruminants and these individual differences lasted 5 years. Moreover, individuals that ingested overall less tannic acid, searched more thoroughly between food sources. When the foraging behaviour was compared with age (11-41 days old and 65-97 days old), it was found that the time a fawn spent eating, increased with age, and the time spent on exploration, smelling and tasting plants decreased with age. Furthermore, the fawns increased their intake of grass and herbs, while the intake of soil and dead plant material decreased with age. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Serious limitations were found in the use of ATP measurements as indicators of Pseudomonas paucimobilis biomass and activity in sterilized soil. These limitations were related to effects of moisture stress, nutrient variation and protozoan predation on soil ATP levels and ATP per bacterium. Rewetting dry soil resulted in an increase (2.2-fold) in ATP per bacterium, as did additions of glucose (5.9-fold) and (NH4)2SO4(2.8-fold). ATP per bacterium also differed between grazed and ungrazed bacteria. Carbon dioxide evolution and ATP concentrations varied independently with time. Thus, except under low nutrient conditions, when neither bacterial numbers nor ATP measurements changed, ATP concentrations did not indicate bacterial population dynamics or respiration. Carbon and nitrogen effects on ATP concentrations were reduced by adding an excess of glucose a few hours before ATP measurements. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Trophic assimilation efficiency (conversion of resource biomass into consumer biomass) is thought to be a limiting factor for food chain length in natural communities. In host–parasitoid systems, which account for the majority of terrestrial consumer interactions, a high trophic assimilation efficiency may be expected at higher trophic levels because of the close match of resource composition of host tissue and the consumer's resource requirements, which would allowfor longer food chains.We measured efficiency of biomass trans- fer along an aphid-primary–secondary–tertiary parasitoid food chain and used stable isotope analysis to confirmtrophic levels.We showhigh efficiency in biomass transfer along the food chain. From the third to the fourth trophic level, the proportion of host biomass transferred was 45%, 65% and 73%, respectively, for three secondary parasitoid species. For two parasitoid species that can act at the fourth and fifth trophic levels,we showmarkedly increased trophic assimilation efficiencies at the higher trophic level, which increa- sed from 45 to 63% and 73 to 93%, respectively. In common with other food chains, d 15N increased with trophic level, with trophic discrimination factors (D15N) 1.34 and 1.49‰ from primary parasitoids to endoparasitic and ecto- parasitic secondary parasitoids, respectively, and 0.78‰ from secondary to tertiary parasitoids. Owing to the extraordinarily high efficiency of hyper- parasitoids, cryptic higher trophic levels may exist in host–parasitoid communities, which could alter our understanding of the dynamics and drivers of community structure of these important systems.},

abstract = {Organic farming practices are regarded as being beneficial for the environment by promoting soil quality and sequestering soil organic carbon (SOC). We studied SOC dynamics in the long-term field experiment DOK in Switzerland. The experiment compares three organically fertilized treatments under conventional (CONFYM), bioorganic (BIOORG), and biodynamic (BIO-DYN) management, and two systems with (CONMIN) or without (NOFERT) mineral fertilizer. We analyzed measured SOC time series from 1977 to 2004 and applied soil fractionation, radiocarbon dating, and modeling with the carbon model RothC. The SOC declined significantly in most parcels, but was not systematically different between systems. Initial SOC contents correlated with soil texture and were identified as being important with respect to the change rate. The SOC loss was at the expense of mineral-associated carbon whereas the more labile fractions increased. The overall decline was explained by reduced carbon inputs since commencement of the experiment and was most pronounced in NOFERT and CONMIN. The model satisfactorily simulated the dynamics of most of the treatments for both initialization with equilibrium runs or measured SOC fractions. Carbon loss in CONFYM was not fully captured by the model. Composition of organic fertilizers depended on the particular management, and a model adjustment of their relative stability improved the match between model and measurements. Model runs without management effects indicated that the observed increase in temperatures at the experimental site does not induce a change in SOC. Overall, the study does not support a benefit of organic farming on SOC contents compared with conventional systems with manure.},

Any vegetation control treatment applied the same year in which the plantation was established did not have an effect on hybrid poplar aboveground growth. However significant differences among treatments were observed belowground, where the removal of the competing vegetation at the tree base increased the fine root:leaf biomass ratio of plants, thus probably facilitating their establishment. In contrast, 2-year-old plants grew better when treated with herbicides, but no positive effect of the mechanical treatments was detected. In both sites, trees growing on herbicide-treated plots showed considerably higher leaf carbon assimilation and leaf N concentration which were both strongly correlated. We conclude that a strong vegetation competition for nutrients takes effect on hybrid poplar plantations on previously forested sites since there was no water shortage for any treatment during the study period. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.},

abstract = {Northern Europe supports large soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and has been subjected to high frequency of land-use changes during the past decades. However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.},

abstract = {Organic farming systems often comprise crops and livestock, recycle farmyard manure for fertilization, and preventive or biocontrol measures are used for plant protection. We determined indicators for soil quality changes in the DOK long-term comparison trial that was initiated in 1978. This replicated field trial comprises organic and integrated (conventional) farming systems that are typical for Swiss agriculture. Livestock based bio-organic (BIOORG), bio-dynamic (BIODYN) and integrated farming systems (CONFYM) were compared at reduced and normal fertilization intensity (0.7 and 1.4livestock units, LU) in a 7 year crop rotation. A stockless integrated system is fertilized with mineral fertilizers exclusively (CONMIN) and one control treatment remained unfertilized (NOFERT). The CONFYM system is amended with stacked manure, supplemental mineral fertilizers, as well as chemical pesticides. Manure of the BIOORG system is slightly rotted and in BIODYN it is composted aerobically with some herbal additives. In the third crop rotation period at normal fertiliser intensity soil organic carbon (Corg, w/w) in the plough layer (0–20cm) of the BIODYN system remained constant and decreased by 7% in CONFYM and 9% in BIOORG as compared to the starting values. With no manure application Corg-loss was severest in NOFERT (22%), followed by CONMIN together with the systems at reduced fertiliser intensity (14–16%). Soil pH tended to increase in the organic systems, whereas the integrated systems had the lowest pH values. At the end of the third crop rotation period in 1998 biological soil quality indicators were determined. Compared to soil microbial biomass in the BIODYN systems the CONFYM soils showed 25% lower values and the systems without manure application were lower by 34%. Relative to the BIODYN soils at the same fertilization intensity dehydrogenase activity was 39–42% lower in CONFYM soils and even 62% lower in soils of CONMIN. Soil basal respiration did not differ between farming systems at the same intensity, but when related to microbial biomass (qCO2) it was 20% higher in CONFYM soils and 52% higher in CONMIN as compared to BIODYN, suggesting a higher maintenance requirement of microbial biomass in soils of the integrated systems. The manure based farming systems of the DOK trial are likely to favour an active and fertile soil. Both, Corg and biological soil quality indicators were clearly depending on the quantity and quality of the applied manure types, but soil microbial biomass and activities were much more affected than Corg.},

abstract = {We used two datasets of 14C analyses of archived soil samples to study carbon turnover in O horizons from spruce dominated old-growth stands on well-drained podzols in Scandinavia. The main data set was obtained from archived samples from the National Forest Soil Inventory in Sweden and represents a climatic gradient in temperature. Composite samples from 1966, 1972, 1983 and 2000 from four different regions in a latitude gradient ranging from 57 to 67N were analysed for 14C content. Along this gradient the C stock in the O horizon ranges from 2.1 kg m-2 in the north to 3.7 kg m-2 in the southwest. The other data set contains 14C analyses from 1986, 1987, 1991, 1996 and 2004 from the O horizons in Birkenes, Norway. Mean residence times (MRT) were calculated using a two compartment model, with a litter decomposition compartment using mass loss data from the literature for the threefirst years of decomposition and a humus decomposition compartment with a fitted constant turnover rate. We hypothesized that the climatic gradient would result in different C turnover in different parts of the country between northern and southern Sweden. The use of archived soil samples was very valuable for constraining the MRT calculations, which showed that there were differences between the regions. Longest MRT was found in the northernmost region (41 years), with decreasing residence times through the middle (36 years) and central Sweden (28 years), then again increasing in the southwestern region (40 years). The size of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the O horizon was mainly related to differences in litter input and to a lesser degree to MRT. Because N deposition leads both to larger litter input and to longer MRT, we suggest that N deposition contributes significantly to the latitudinal SOC gradient in Scandinavia, with approximately twice as much SOC in the O horizon in the south compared to the north. The data from Birkenes was in good agreement with the Swedish dataset with MRT estimated to 34 years.},

abstract = {Elevated dissolved carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations are frequently observed in surface water soon after clear-cutting of boreal coniferous forests. It has been suggested that they originate from the fine logging residues whose decomposition may be accelerated as a result of changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions. In the present study, the decomposition rate and release of C, N, and P from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies Karsten) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) logging residues (fine roots ∅≤2 mm, branches ∅≤10 mm and foliage) were investigated during three years with the litterbag method in a clear-cut area and in an adjacent Norway spruce dominated, mixed boreal forest in eastern Finland (63°51′ N, 28°58′ E, 220 m asl). The mass loss of the logging residues decreased in the order: foliage > roots > branches. Birch leaves were the only fraction that showed significantly higher losses of mass and C at the clear-cut plot than at the forest plot; otherwise there was no tendency for accelerated decomposition or mineralization at the clear-cut plot. After three years the initial C pool in the logging residues had declined by 33% and that of P by 49% but there was no net release of N as more N accumulated in roots and branches than was released from foliage. The results indicate that 1) logging residues release relatively large and rapid fluxes of CO 2 to the atmosphere 2) are potential source of elevated P in surface waters soon after clear-cutting 3) are not a net source of N immediately after clear-cutting.},

@article{Baveye2019,
abstract = {Three years ago, a novel “soil continuum model” was proposed, in which soil organic matter was suggested to be of heterogeneous composition and to consist of a continuum of organic fragments of all sizes. A search of the literature reveals that this model is identical to several similar conceptualizations proposed about 15 years ago, and that it corresponds closely with the description of humic substances given in Waksman's (1936) remarkably thorough book on the topic, that also emphasized the intimate connections existing between humic substances and soil microorganisms. Several historical reasons, reviewed in this Perspective article, may explain why Waksman's viewpoint might still be considered novel more than 80 years later. Here we argue that the key reason for the agonizingly slow rate of progress in the field is linked to the extreme compartmentalization of research and education in soil science, which has been organized along distinct subdisciplines, with the result that interdisciplinary efforts that are desperately needed to understand the dynamics of soil humic substances are very hard to launch. To meet growing demands on soils we need to understand the mechanisms that underpin their many functions. To gain this understanding and finally make badly needed progress, we must reorganize funding and educational efforts to support exploration of “Waksman's frontier”, which includes the microscale where the microbial, physical and biochemical processes governing organic matter turnover occur.},

abstract = {Background and aims Characterising the spatial distribution of tree fine roots (diameter ≤ 2 mm) is fundamental for a better understanding of belowground functioning when tree are grown with associated crops in agroforestry systems. Our aim was to compare fine root distributions and orientations in trees grown in an alley cropping agroforestry stand with those in a tree monoculture. Methods Fieldwork was conducted in two adjacent 17 year old hybrid walnut (Juglans regia × nigra L.) stands in southern France: the agroforestry stand was intercropped with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) whereas the tree monoculture had a natural understorey. Root intercepts were mapped to a depth of 150 cm on trench walls in both stands, and to a depth of 400 cm in the agroforestry stand in order to characterise tree root distribution below the crop's maximum rooting depth. Soil cubes were then extracted to assess three dimensional root orientation and to establish a predictive model of root length densities (RLD) derived from root intersection densities (RID). Results In the tree monoculture, root mapping demonstrated a very high tree RID in the top 50 cm and a slight decrease in RID with increasing soil depth. However, in the agroforestry stand, RID was significantly lower at 50 cm, tree roots colonized deeper soil layers and were more vertically oriented. In the agroforestry stand, RID and RLD were greater within the tree row than in the inter-row. Conclusions Fine roots of intercropped walnut trees grew significantly deeper, indicating a strong plasticity in root distribution. This plasticity reduced direct root competition from the crop, enabling trees to access deeper water tables not available to crop roots.},

abstract = {Below ground carbon (BGC) inputs to soil, i.e. root biomass and rhizodeposition carbon (C), are among the most important variables driving soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Hence, increasing BGC inputs to deep soil is a proposed strategy to sequester C in the long term. As BGC inputs are inherently difficult to measure in the field, they are usually estimated from yield in order to supply soil C models with input data. While fertilization intensity considerably affects above ground biomass, its influence on BGC inputs is largely unclear, especially with respect to the subsoil. Therefore, we determined net root biomass and rhizodeposition C of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest in different farming systems (bio-organic, conventional) and fertilization treatments (zero, manure, mineral) along an intensity gradient in two Swiss long-term field trials. Plants in microplots were repeatedly pulse-labelled with13C-CO2throughout the growing seasons and shoots, roots, and soil to 0.75 m depth were sampled at harvest. Despite a strong increase of above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity, BGC inputs were similar among treatments on both sites irrespective of soil depth. However, the proportions of rhizodeposition C of BGC inputs averaged 54 to 63% and were, therefore, much larger than the widely adopted 40% for field-grown cereals. They increased with soil depth and were highest under sole organic fertilization. The shift in whole-plant C allocation towards above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity entailed 10% higher C allocation below ground in organic than conventional farming for both maize and wheat. Our findings imply that yield-independent values provide closer estimates for BGC inputs to soil of cereals in different farming systems than yield-based functions. We further conclude that fertilization has only little potential to alter absolute amounts of BGC inputs to deep soil in order to sequester C in the long term.},

abstract = {Reforestation is an important tool for reducing or reversing biodiversity loss and mitigating climate change. However, there are many potential compromises between the structural (biodiversity) and functional (carbon sequestration and water yield) effects of reforestation, which can be affected by decisions on spatial design and establishment of plantings. We review the environmental responses to reforestation and show that manipulating the configuration of plantings (location, size, species mix and tree density) increases a range of environmental benefits. More extensive tree plantings (>10. ha) provide more habitat, and greater improvements to carbon and water cycling. Planting a mixture of native trees and shrubs is best for biodiversity, while traditional plantation species, generally non-native species, sequester C faster. Tree density can be manipulated at planting or during early development to accelerate structural maturity and to manage water yields. A diversity of habitats will be created by planting in a variety of landscape positions and by emulating the patchy distribution of forest types, which characterized many regions prior to extensive landscape transformation. Areas with shallow aquifers can be planted to reduce water pollution or avoided to maintain water yields. Reforestation should be used to build forest networks that are surrounded by low-intensity land use and that provide links within regions and between biomes. While there are adequate models for C sequestration and changes in water yields after reforestation, the quantitative understanding of changes in habitat resources and species composition is more limited. Development of spatial and temporal modelling platforms based on empirical models of structural and functional outcomes of reforestation is essential for deciding how to reconfigure agricultural regions. To build such platforms, we must quantify: (a) the influence of previous land uses, establishment methods, species mixes and interactions with adjacent land uses on environmental (particularly biodiversity) outcomes of reforestation and (b) the ways in which responses measured at the level of individual plantings scale up to watersheds and regions. Models based on this information will help widespread reforestation for carbon sequestration to improve native biodiversity, nutrient cycling and water balance at regional scales.},

abstract = {Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.},

abstract = {Deadwood is a substantial component of forests playing a central role in many ecosystem processes. It provides habitats for a multitude of wood-dependent organisms, maintaining the ecosystem health and reducing the effect of natural disturbances. Deadwood is recognized as an indicator of local species diversity and contributes to the global carbon pools and nutrient cycles. Despite its importance, how saproxylic communities respond to deadwood dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales is still not clear. With the present review, we aim to summarize the effects of deadwood characteristics on the diversity and composition of saproxylic insects and fungi, with focus on European forests. We also discuss the influence of other biotic and abiotic components that indirectly affect these communities by altering wood continuity and variety. Niche differentiation is the main ecological driver of saproxylic organisms, as the presence of multiple microhabitats supports differently specialized taxa. The assemblage and richness of these saproxylic communities within forest ecosystems can be considered as indicators of climate-smart forestry trajectories. This aspect deserves to be regarded as a major target in sustainable forest management plans, especially in mountain areas, where the conservation of threatened species and the promotion of biodiverse forests are considered a priority.},

abstract = {Root traits are important to crop functioning, yet there is little information about how root traits vary with shoot traits. Using a standardized protocol, we collected 160 soil cores (0−210 cm) across 10 locations, three years and multiple cropping systems (crops x management practices) in Iowa, USA. Maximum root biomass ranged from 1.2 to 2.8 Mg ha−1 in maize and 0.86 to 1.93 Mg ha−1 in soybean. The root:shoot (R:S) ratio ranged from 0.04 to 0.13 in maize and 0.09 to 0.26 in soybean. Maize produced 27 % more root biomass, 20 % longer roots, with 35 % higher carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio than soybean. In contrast, soybean had a 47 % greater R:S ratio than maize. The maize R:S ratio values were substantially lower than literature values, possibly due to differences in measurement methodologies, genotypes, and environment. In particular, we sampled at plant maturity rather than crop harvest to minimize the effect of senescence on measurements of shoots and roots. Maximum shoot biomass explained 70 % of the variation in root biomass, and the R:S ratio was positively correlated with the root C:N measured in both crops. Easily-measured environmental variables including temperature and precipitation were weakly associated with root traits. These results begin to fill an important knowledge gap that will enable better estimates of belowground net primary productivity and soil organic matter dynamics. Ultimately, the ability to explain variation in root mass production can be used to improve C and N budgets and modeling studies from crop to regional scales.},

abstract = {Temperate forest soils store large amounts of organic matter and are considered as net sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Information about the sink strength and the turnover time of soil organic carbon (SOC) is required to assess the potential response of soils to climate change. Here we report on stocks, turnover times (TT) and accumulation of SOC in bulk soil and density fractions from genetic horizons of a Podzol in the Fichtelgebirge, Germany. Stocks of SOC, total nitrogen and exchangeable cations determined in nine quantitative soil pits strongly varied with stone content and thickness of horizons in both the organic layer and the mineral soil. On the basis of radiocarbon signatures, mean turnover times of 4, 9 and 133 years, respectively, were calculated for Oi, Oe and Oa horizons from three soil pits, using a non-steady-state model. The Oa horizons accumulated 4–8 g C m−2 year−1 whereas the Oi and Oe horizons were close to steady-state during the past decade. Free particulate organic matter (FPOM) was the most abundant fraction in the Oa and EA horizons with TT of 70–480 years. In the B horizons, mineral associated organic matter (MAOM) dominated with over 40% of total SOC and had TT of 390–2170 years. In contrast to other horizons, MAOM in the Bsh and Bs horizon had generally faster TT than occluded particulate organic matter (OPOM), possibly because of sorption of dissolved organic carbon by iron and aluminium oxides/hydroxides. Our results suggest that organic horizons with relatively short turnover times could be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate or other disturbances.},

abstract = {Background: The Brazilian savanna, or Cerrado, has been described as an 'upside-down forest', with higher below-ground than above-ground biomass. The cerrado vegetation, ranging from open grasslands to forests, comprises a wide range of ecological conditions and plant biomass.Aims: To determine if and how root:shoot ratio in 102 trees differed between open- (cerrado sensu stricto) and closed-canopy cerrado (cerrad{\~{a}}o) within the same region in south-eastern Brazil.Methods: Differences in root:shoot ratios and environmental conditions between the two cerrado types were examined, by uprooting and weighing trees from different species and functional groups.Results: Root:shoot ratio was higher in the open than in the closed cerrado, especially among deciduous species. Root:shoot ratio in the open cerrado was lower than reported for the same cerrado type in central Brazil. Soil fertility did not differ between cerrado types, but soil water was lower and light availability was higher in the open cerrado.Conclusions: The lower root:shoot ratio in closed than in open cerrado is probably a response to lower light and higher soil water availability, and/or to less frequent fires. Estimates of above-ground carbon storage alone significantly underestimate the carbon stock in open relative to closed cerrado. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Uneven-aged forests are assumed to have a high stability against storm damagebut have rarely been analysed for vulnerability to storm damage due to a lack of a sufficient empirical database. Here we model storm damage in uneven-aged forest to analyse major factors that may determine the sensitivity of this type of forests to storms based on a broad database. Data are derived of public forests in the canton Neuch{\^{a}} tel in West Switzerland that are dominated by silver fir and Norway spruce and managed since the beginning of the 20th century following a single-tree selection system.Auniquedataset of periodical (every5-10years) full inventories measuring the diameter of every single tree including salvage cuttingswas available for the investigation. The time series reached back until 1920 and covered an area of 16 000 ha divided into 3000 divisions. The effect of a major winter storm ('Lothar') in December 1999 on these forests was investigated using a subset of 648 divisions. The influence of the vertical stand structure on the vulnerability of storm damage was studied using logistic regression models. To facilitate the analyses, an index of closeness to a J-shaped distribution (LikeJ) based on the number of trees in different diameter classes was developed. Besides structural indices, variables representing stand characteristics, soil-related and topography-related variables were included. The results of our study show that the overall damage level of the investigated forests was rather low. The variables that entered the model for the unevenaged stands were different to those that are normally significant for even-aged stands. While variables like stand structure, the timing of the harvesting and topographic variables entered a multivariate statistical model as significant predictors, standard predictors for storm damage in even-aged stands such as stand density, thinning intensity or species composition were not significant.We hypothesize that the uneven-aged structure of the investigated forests may be one reason for the low damage level we observed but emphasize the need for more detailed research to support this conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

Ecological complexity has been linked to concepts such as ecological integrity, diversity and resilience and has been put forth as a candidate ecological orientor. In this article, the concept of complexity as a system attribute is presented and candidate measures of ecological complexity are reviewed. The measures are distinguished by their ability to characterize the spatial, temporal, structural or spatiotemporal signatures of an ecosystem. Many of these measures have been adapted from disciplines such as physics and information theory that have a long history of quantifying complexity, however more work needs to be done to develop techniques adapted to ecological data. It is argued that if appropriate measures are developed and validated for ecosystems, ecological complexity could become a key ecological indicator. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dormant bacterial spores can rapidly revive and resume a vegetative life form once nutrients become available (Stragier and Losick, 1996; Setlow, 2003). The earliest revival event, termed germination, holds the key to understanding this rapid conversion from a dormant into an active cell. During germination, the spore undergoes release of dipicolinic acid (DPA), rehydration, cortex hydrolysis, and coat disassembly. This phase is accompanied by transition from a phase-bright spore to a phase-dark cell, as manifested by light microscopy (Setlow, 2003, 2013; Moir, 2006; Figure 1A). Germination is traditionally considered to occur without the need for any macromolecule synthesis (Steinberg et al., 1965; Vinter, 1970; Setlow, 2003, 2013; Moir, 2006); however, our recent results challenge this view, as we demonstrated that translation occurs during germination and is required for its execution (Sinai et al., 2015). Utilizing Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) as a model organism, we provided several lines of evidence supporting this view:},

abstract = {Studies of the decomposition, transformation and stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) have dramatically increased in recent years owing to growing interest in studying the global carbon (C) cycle as it pertains to climate change. While it is readily accepted that the magnitude of the organic C reservoir in soils depends upon microbial involvement, as soil C dynamics are ultimately the consequence of microbial growth and activity, it remains largely unknown how these microorganism-mediated processes lead to soil C stabilization. Here, we define two pathways-ex vivo modification and in vivo turnover-which jointly explain soil C dynamics driven by microbial catabolism and/or anabolism. Accordingly, we use the conceptual framework of the soil 'microbial carbon pump' (MCP) to demonstrate how microorganisms are an active player in soil C storage. The MCP couples microbial production of a set of organic compounds to their further stabilization, which we define as the entombing effect. This integration captures the cumulative long-Term legacy of microbial assimilation on SOM formation, with mechanisms (whether via physical protection or a lack of activation energy due to chemical composition) that ultimately enable the entombment of microbial-derived C in soils. We propose a need for increased efforts and seek to inspire new studies that utilize the soil MCP as a conceptual guideline for improving mechanistic understandings of the contributions of soil C dynamics to the responses of the terrestrial C cycle under global change.},

abstract = {<p>Changes in global soil carbon stocks have considerable potential to influence the course of future climate change. However, a portion of soil organic carbon (SOC) has a very long residence time (>&thinsp;100 years) and may not contribute significantly to terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions during the next century. The size of this persistent SOC reservoir is presumed to be large. Consequently, it is a key parameter required for the initialization of SOC dynamics in ecosystem and Earth system models, but there is considerable uncertainty in the methods used to quantify it. Thermal analysis methods provide cost-effective information on SOC thermal stability that has been shown to be qualitatively related to SOC biogeochemical stability. The objective of this work was to build the first quantitative thermal analysis based model of the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool. We used a unique set of soil samples from four agronomic experiments in Northwestern Europe with long-term bare fallow and non-bare fallow treatments (e.g. manure amendment, cropland and grassland), as a sample set for which estimating the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool is relatively straightforward. At each experimental site, we estimated the average concentration of centennially persistent SOC and its uncertainty by applying a Bayesian curve fitting method on the observed declining SOC concentration over the duration of the long-term bare fallow treatment. Overall, the estimated concentrations of centennially persistent SOC ranged from 5 to 11&thinsp;gC.kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> soil (lowest and highest boundaries of four 95&thinsp;% confidence intervals). Then, by dividing site-specific concentrations of persistent SOC by the total SOC concentration of 118 archived soil samples from long-term bare fallow and non-bare fallow treatments, we could estimate the proportion of centennially persistent SOC in the samples and the associated uncertainty. The proportion of centennially persistent SOC ranged from 0.14 (standard deviation of 0.01) to 1 (standard deviation of 0.15). Samples were subjected to thermal analysis by Rock-Eval 6 that generated a series of 30 parameters reflecting their SOC thermal stability and bulk chemistry. The sample set was split into a calibration set (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;88) and a validation set (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;30). We trained a non-parametric machine learning algorithm (random forests multivariate regression model) that accurately predicted the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool using Rock-Eval 6 thermal parameters as predictors in the calibration set (pseudo-R²&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.91, RMSEC&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.06) and the validation set (R²&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.91, RMSEP&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.07). The uncertainty of the predictions obtained using the multivariate regression model was quantified by a Monte Carlo approach that produced conservative 95% prediction intervals across the 30 samples of the validation set. This model based on Rock-Eval 6 thermal analysis can thus be used to predict the proportion of centennially persistent SOC with known uncertainty in new soil samples from similar pedoclimates. Our study strengthens the evidence for a link between the thermal and biogeochemical stability of soil organic matter, and demonstrates that Rock-Eval 6 thermal analysis can be used to quantify the size of the centennially persistent organic carbon pool in temperate soils.</p>},

abstract = {We examined decay rates and storage of coarse woody debris (CWD) of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L., Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst., birch Betula spp. and aspen Populus tremula L. Based on chronosequence with direct measurements, dynamics of decay of CWD were reconstructed in different forests throughout the Leningrad Region. Multiple exponential and lag-time functions were used to fit obtained data. Results revealed the shortest decomposition period for aspen with 85% of the initial mass lost in 27 yr for logs 5-25 cm, 43 yr for 25-60 cm, and 106 yr for bark. Birch had similar values, with 85% of the initial mass lost in 21 yr for logs 5-15 cm, 49 yr for 15-60 cm, and 84 yr for bark. Spruce had intermediate values with 85% of the initial mass lost in 32 yr for logs 5-20 cm, 60 yr for 20-40 cm, 74 yr for 40-60 cm, 112 yr for bark and 71 yr for coarse roots. Pine CWD decayed most slowly, with 85% of the initial mass lost in 37 yr for logs 5-15 cm, 83 yr for 15-35 cm, 98 yr for 35-60 cm and 206 yr for bark. CWD input and transformation over time were modeled. The model is based on conceptual pattern of ecosystem dynamics, beginning with an initial clearcut in virgin forest. Results indicated that CWD mass generally followed the U-shaped curve, which is most pronounced for spruce and pine. Forest inventory data on growing stock were used to calculate potential storage of CWD in the Leningrad Region. Application of the model resulted in wide range of CWD storage with highest values in spruce and pine stands (39 and 37 Tg C respectively), moderate values in birch stands (21 Tg C) and lowest values in aspen stands -- 7 Tg C (1 Tg=10⁶t). Ratio of total CWD mass to live phytomass in this area was 0.42. CR - Copyright &#169; 2001 Oikos Editorial Office},

abstract = {Management of native forests offers opportunities to store more carbon in the land sector through two main activities. Emissions to the atmosphere can be avoided by ceasing logging. Removals of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can be increased by allowing forests to continue growing. However, the relative benefits for carbon storage of managing native forests for wood production versus protection are contested. Additionally, the potential for carbon storage is impacted upon by disturbance events, such as wildfire, that alter the amount and longevity of carbon stocks. Using a case study of montane ash forests in southeastern Australia, we demonstrated that the total biomass carbon stock in logged forest was 55% of the stock in old growth forest. Total biomass included above- and belowground, living and dead. Biomass carbon stock was calculated spatially as an average across the landscape, accounting for variation in environmental conditions and forest age distribution. Reduction in carbon stock in logged forest was due to 66% of the initial biomass being made into products with short lifetimes (<3 years), and to the lower average age of logged forest (<50 years compared with >100 years in old growth forest). Only 4% of the initial carbon stock in the native forest was converted to sawn timber products with lifetimes of 30-90 years. Carbon stocks are depleted in a harvested forest system compared with an old growth forest, even when storage in wood products and landfill are included. We estimated that continued logging under current plans represented a loss of 5.56 Tg C over 5 years in the area logged (824 km2), compared with a potential gain of 5.18-6.05 TgC over 5 years by allowing continued growth across the montane ash forest region (2326 km2). Avoiding emissions by not logging native forests and allowing them to continue growing is therefore an important form of carbon sequestration. The mitigation value of forest management options of protection versus logging should be assessed in terms of the amount, longevity and resilience of the carbon stored in the forest, rather than the annual rate of carbon uptake. {\textcopyright} 2014 Keith et al.},

Social scientists both analyse why society courts disaster by approaching or even overstepping these boundaries and try to design suitable policies to avoid these perils. Because the threats of transgressing planetary boundaries are global, long-run, uncertain and interconnected, they must be analysed together to avoid conflicts and take advantage of synergies. To obtain policies that are effective at both international and local levels requires careful analysis of the underlying mechanisms across scientific disciplines and approaches, and must take politics into account. In this Perspective, we examine the complexities of designing policies that can keep Earth within the biophysical limits favourable to human life.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) contents are controlled partly by plant inputs that can be manipulated in agricultural systems. Although SOC and N pools occur mainly in the topsoil (upper 0.30 m), there are often substantial pools in the subsoil that are commonly assumed to be stable. We tested the hypothesis that contrasting long-term management systems change the dynamics of SOC and N in the topsoil and subsoil (to 0.75 m) under temperate conditions. We used an established field experiment in the UK where control grassland was changed to arable (59 years before) and bare fallow (49 years before) systems. Losses of SOC and N were 65 and 61% under arable and 78 and 74% under fallow, respectively, in the upper 0.15 m when compared with the grass land soil, whereas at 0.3-0.6-m depth losses under arable and fallow were 41 and 22% and 52 and 35%, respectively. The stable isotopes 13C and 15N showed the effects of different treatments. Concentrations of long-chain n-alkanes C27, C29 and C31 were greater in soil under grass than under arable and fallow. The dynamics of SOC and N changed in both topsoil and subsoil on a decadal time-scale because of changes in the balance between inputs and turnover in perennial and annual systems. Isotopic and geochemical analyses suggested that fresh inputs and decomposition processes occur in the subsoil. There is a need to monitor and predict long-term changes in soil properties in the whole soil profile if soil is to be managed sustainably. HIGHLIGHTS: Land-use change affects soil organic carbon and nitrogen, but usually the topsoil only is considered.Grassland cultivated to arable and fallow lost 13-78% SOC and N to 0.6 m depth within decades.Isotopic and biomarker analyses suggested changes in delivery and turnover of plant-derived inputs.The full soil profile must be considered to assess soil quality and sustainability.},

abstract = {The finding that regular spatial patterns can emerge in nature from local interactions between organisms has prompted a search for the ecological importance of these patterns. Theoretical models have predicted that patterning may have positive emergent effects on fundamental ecosystem functions, such as productivity. We provide empirical support for this prediction. In dryland ecosystems, termite mounds are often hotspots of plant growth (primary productivity). Using detailed observations and manipulative experiments in an African savanna, we show that these mounds are also local hotspots of animal abundance (secondary and tertiary productivity): insect abundance and biomass decreased with distance from the nearest termite mound, as did the abundance, biomass, and reproductive output of insect-eating predators. Null-model analyses indicated that at the landscape scale, the evenly spaced distribution of termite mounds produced dramatically greater abundance, biomass, and reproductive output of consumers across trophic levels than would be obtained in landscapes with randomly distributed mounds. These emergent properties of spatial pattern arose because the average distance from an arbitrarily chosen point to the nearest feature in a landscape is minimized in landscapes where the features are hyper-dispersed (i.e., uniformly spaced). This suggests that the linkage between patterning and ecosystem functioning will be common to systems spanning the range of human management intensities. The centrality of spatial pattern to system-wide biomass accumulation underscores the need to conserve pattern-generating organisms and mechanisms, and to incorporate landscape patterning in efforts to restore degraded habitats and maximize the delivery of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations are of interest as producers of biomass for fuel, but also as carbon (C) sinks to mitigate CO2 emissions. Carbon sequestration in biomass and soil was estimated in 5-year-old replicated SRC plantations with willows (Salix spp.) on former arable land at five sites in Sweden. Total standing C stocks, i.e. C stored in woody biomass above- and belowground, fine root standing crop, litter, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were estimated by repeated field sampling and C budget calculation.Overall, the SRC willow plantations represented a C sink after five years. Estimated increase of total standing C stock was 15% on average compared to pre-planting conditions. There was no change in SOC when including all sites. Analyses within sites revealed a decrease in SOC at one site, although the decrease was compensated for by C stored in willow biomass. After removal of stem biomass, C in other plant pools was sufficient to compensate for the SOC decrease. Remaining C in stumps, stool, and coarse roots was estimated at ca 20% of stem C.There was a discrepancy between SOC sequestration rates from soil sampling and C budget calculation, -2.1-1.0 and 0.15-0.45 Mg ha-1 y-1, respectively. Mineralization of old organic material from previous land-use and input to SOC from understory vegetation were not included in the calculations, which may explain part of the differences. The importance of understory litter in C budgets for young plantations was apparent, as it comprised 24-80% of aboveground litter C.},

However, the standard method of calculating Delta(14)C, which corrects sample C-14 activity for isotopic fractionation by correcting the sample delta(13)C to - 25%, introduces significant errors to the reported C-14 values. For elevated-CO2 treatments the error arises because the delta(13)C of the sample is not an appropriate measure of isotopic fractionation to use when correcting sample C-14 activity for isotopic fractionation. A suggested replacement approach, developed in this paper, is to use the delta(13)C of the same type of material (e.g. leaf, soil organic matter) from the control (ambient-CO2) treatment in place of the sample delta(13)C in the correction.},

abstract = {To quantify the effects of soil temperature (T-soil), and relative soil water content (RSWC) on soil respiration we measured CO2 soil efflux with a closed dynamic chamber in situ in the field and from soil cores in a controlled climate chamber experiment. Additionally we analysed the effect of soil acidity and fine root mass in the field. The analysis was performed on three meadow, two bare fallow and one forest sites. The influence of soil temperature on CO2 emissions was highly significant with all land-use types, except for one field campaign with continuous rain. Where soil temperature had a significant influence, the percentage of variance explained by soil temperature varied from site to site from 13-46% in the field and 35-66% in the climate chamber. Changes of soil moisture influenced only the CO2 efflux on meadow soils in field and climate chamber (14-34% explained variance), whereas on the bare soil and the forest soil there was no visible effect. The spatial variation of soil CO2 emission in the field correlated significantly with the soil pH and fine root mass, explaining up to 24% and 31% of the variability. A non-linear regression model was developed to describe soil CO2 efflux as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture, pH-value and root mass. With the model we could explain 60% of the variability in soil CO2 emission of all individual field chamber measurements. Through the model analysis we highlight the temporal influence of rain events. The model overestimated the observed fluxes during and within four hours of the last rain event. Conversely, after more than 72 h without rain the model underestimated the fluxes. Between four and 72 h after rainfall, the regression model of soil CO2 emission explained up to 91% of the variance.},

abstract = {Soil microorganisms play important roles in soil quality and plant productivity. The development of effective methods for studying the diversity, distribution, and behavior of microorganisms in soil habitats is essential for a broader understanding of soil health. Traditionally, the analysis of soil microbial communities has relied on culturing techniques using a variety of culture media designed to maximize the recovery of diverse microbial populations. However, only a small fraction (<0.1%) of the soil microbial community has been accessible with this approach. To overcome these problems, other methods such as the analysis of phospholipid fatty acids and community-level physiological profiles have been utilized in an attempt to access a greater proportion of the soil microbial community. In recent years, molecular methods for soil microbial community analysis have provided a new understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities in soil. Among the most useful of these methods are those in which small subunit rRNA genes are amplified from soil-extracted nucleic acids. Using these techniques, it is possible to characterize and study soil microbes that currently cannot be cultured. Microbial rRNA genes can be detected directly from soil samples and sequenced. These sequences can then be compared with those from other known microorganisms. Additionally, group- and taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes can be developed from these sequences making direct visualization of microorganisms in soil habitats possible. The use of these techniques provides new ways of assessing soil microbial diversity and ultimately, a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of environmental processes and human activities on responses of soil microorganisms. Information gained from such studies will have direct impacts on our understanding of the role of microbial processes in soil health. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Changes in soil organic carbon stocks were simulated with the Rothamsted carbon (RothC) model. We evaluated the calculation of a major input variable, the amount of inert organic matter (IOM), using measurable data. Three different approaches for quantifying IOM were applied to soils with mainly recent organic matter and with carbon contribution from fossil fuels: 1) IOM estimation via total soil organic carbon (SOC); 2) through bulk soil radiocarbon and a mass balance; and 3) by quantifying the portion of black carbon via a specific marker. The results were highly variable in the soil containing lignite-derived carbon and ranged from 8% to 52% inert carbon of total SOC, while nearly similar amounts of 5% to 8% were determined in the soil with mainly recent organic matter. We simulated carbon dynamics in both soils using the 3 approaches for quantifying IOM in combination with carbon inputs derived from measured crop yields. In the soil with recent organic matter, all approaches gave a nearly similar good agreement between measured and modeled data, while in the soil with a fossil carbon admixture, only the C-14 approach was successful in matching the measured data. Although C-14 was useful for initializing RothC, care should be taken when interpreting SOC dynamics in soils containing carbon from fossil fuels, since these reflect the contribution from both natural and anthropogenic carbon sources.},

abstract = {Insular Southeast Asian peatlands have experienced rapid land cover changes over the past decades inducing a variety of environmental effects ranging from regional consequences on peatland ecology, biodiversity and hydrology to globally significant carbon emissions. In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and small-holder dominated areas) cover 50% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.},

abstract = {The plant-available pools of calcium, magnesium and potassium are assumed to be stored in the soil as exchangeable cations adsorbed on the cation exchange complex. In numerous forest ecosystems, despite very low plant-available pools, elevated forest productivities are sustained. We hypothesize that trees access nutrient sources in the soil that are currently unaccounted by conventional soil analysis methods. We carried out an isotopic dilution assay to quantify the plant-available pools of calcium, magnesium and potassium and trace the soil phases that support these pools in 143 individual soil samples covering 3 climatic zones and 5 different soil types. For 81%, 87% and 90% of the soil samples (respectively for Ca, Mg and K), the plant-available pools measured by isotopic dilution were greater than the conventional exchangeable pool. This additional pool is most likely supported by secondary non-crystalline mineral phases in interaction with soil organic matter and represents in many cases (respectively 43%, 27% and 47% of the soil samples) a substantial amount of plant-available nutrient cations (50% greater than the conventional exchangeable pools) that is likely to play an essential role in the biogeochemical functioning of forest ecosystems, in particular when the resources of Ca, Mg and K are low.},

abstract = {Stumps are a source of renewable energy (bioenergy) that can mitigate climate change. We aimed to determine whether conclusions from recent studies could be generalized for other sites by monitoring the in situ soil respiration (Rs) by a portable soil-respiration system of 14 clear-cut experimental sites during the first 2 years after stump extraction and site preparation. The sites were established all over Sweden in 2013 and 2014 and were subjected to no disturbance (Control), patch scarification (PatchS), disc trenching (DiscT), and stump harvesting (StumpH). During year 1, Rs from sites treated with PatchS and StumpH were 11% and 13% lower than Rs from Control sites. DiscT-treated sites were apt to produce lower Rs than the Control (−9%, p =.09). In the second year, there were no significant differences in Rs between treatments, as no soil disturbance type occurring after stump harvest and site preparation had higher Rs than untreated, intact soil. Our results suggest that soil disturbances resulting from stump harvest and site preparation do not generally increase Rs and thus, from this perspective, provide support for the use of stumps for bioenergy.},

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes represent a public good for microbial communities, as they break down complex molecules into simple molecules that microbes can take up. These communities are vulnerable to cheating by microbes that do not produce enzymes, but benefit from those produced by others. However, extracellular enzymes are ubiquitous and play an important role in the depolymerization of nutrients. We developed a multi-genotype, multi-nutrient model of a community of exoenzyme-producing microbes, in order to investigate the relationship between diversity, social interactions, and nutrient depolymerization. We focused on coalitions between complementary types of microbes and their implications for spatial pattern formation and nutrient depolymerization. The model included polymers containing carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus, and eight genotypes of bacteria, which produced different subsets of the three enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing these polymers. We allowed social dynamics to emerge from a mechanistic model of enzyme production, action, and diffusion. We found that diversity was maximized at high rates of either diffusion or enzyme production (but not both). Conditions favoring cheating also favored the emergence of coalitions. We characterized the spatial patterns formed by different interactions, showing that same-type cooperation leads to aggregation, but between-type cooperation leads to an interwoven, filamentous pattern. Contrary to expectations based on niche complementarity, we found that nutrient depolymerization declined with increasing diversity due to a negative competitive effect of coalitions on generalist producers, leading to less overall enzyme production. This decline in depolymerization was stronger for non-limiting nutrients in the system. This study shows that social interactions among microbes foraging for complementary resources can influence microbial diversity, microbial spatial distributions, and rates of nutrient depolymerization.},

abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in forests but conservation measures to increase CWD must be performed cost efficiently. We estimate least-cost combinations of CWD-increasing measures in a spruce-dominated Swedish forest estate. Specifically, we investigate how using combinations of the measures tree retention, creating high stumps, manual scarification, prolonged rotations, and retention of dying trees impacts the amount of CWD and net present value at the estate level. We found that by combining CWD-increasing measures in an optimal way the amount of CWD on the estate could be increased 322% with a decrease in present value of only 10%. The optimal combination of conservation measures depends on the desired increase in CWD. The analysis thus shows that huge improvements in cost-efficiency of biodiversity-oriented forestry are possible. {\textcopyright} 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Ume{\aa}.},

abstract = {The ‘4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate' was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 %) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England & Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha− 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year− 1, which effectively offset 20–35% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

abstract = {Comprehensive information on crop damage by wildlife species is critical if effective strategies for controlling wildlife damage are to be formulated. Discriminating how landscape composition and configuration attributes influence crop damage is important for implementing landscape management techniques to resolve human–wildlife conflicts. We analyzed crop damage data from 100 corn fields and 60 soybean fields located in the Upper Wabash River Basin of northern Indiana during 2003 and 2004. We used negative binomial regression to model the rate of damage to corn and soybean crops in response to local and landscape variables. Rate of crop damage was best predicted by a combination of local and landscape variables for both corn and soybeans. Models with landscape configuration variables were better able to explain patterns of corn damage, and models with landscape composition variables (specifically, amount of wooded areas) were better able to explain patterns of soybean damage. In general, rate of crop damage was negatively related to size of the crop field and positively related to proportion of a field's perimeter that was adjacent to wooded areas, amount of wooded areas, amount of forest edge, and mean size of forest patches. Specific associations between local and landscape variables and rates of crop damage may serve as a guide to planting strategies and landscape management to minimize wildlife damage to crops.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is primarily formed from plant inputs, but the relative carbon (C) contributions from living root inputs (i.e. rhizodeposits) vs litter inputs (i.e. root + shoot litter) are poorly understood. Recent theory suggests that living root inputs exert a disproportionate influence on SOC formation, but few field studies have explicitly tested this by separately tracking living root vs litter inputs as they move through the soil food web and into distinct SOC pools. We used a manipulative field experiment with an annual C4 grass in a forest understory to differentially track its living root vs litter inputs into the soil and to assess net SOC formation over multiple years. We show that living root inputs are 2-13 times more efficient than litter inputs in forming both slow-cycling, mineral-associated SOC as well as fast-cycling, particulate organic C. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living root inputs are more efficiently anabolized by the soil microbial community en route to the mineral-associated SOC pool (dubbed 'the in vivo microbial turnover pathway'). Overall, our findings provide support for the primacy of living root inputs in forming SOC. However, we also highlight the possibility of nonadditive effects of living root and litter inputs, which may deplete SOC pools despite greater SOC formation rates.},

abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250 m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods — random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression — as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56 % (coarse fragments) and 83 % (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61 %. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230 %. Improvements can be attributed to the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modelling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available via a Web Coverage Service and via the SoilInfo App under the Open Data Base License.},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of litter and soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation is important because it determines how strong the feedback from the expected warmer climate may be on the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We have used a simple, analytical model to investigate how three different mechanism (i) the rate at which decomposers take up substrate at their surface; (ii) the rate by which substrate diffuses up to the surface of the decomposer; and (iii) the rate at which substrate is made available in the environment interact to determine the temperature response. The mechanisms are characterised by activation energies; two for the uptake rate (i) and one for each of the other two (ii, iii). The model shows that the temperature dependence is the result of the number of processes that effectively contributes to the rate of mineralisation; this result should also be valid if other processes are included. Depending upon the relative magnitude of the four activation energies, the temperature response is mainly determined by one or two of the mechanisms. In a transition zone, where all activation energies are similar and the number of contributing processes changes, there can be either a sharp increase or a sharp decrease in the temperature response when activation energies change.

abstract = {The surface area of soil is an important determinant of mineral weathering rates, but is infrequently measured. Simple texture-based pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been used to predict the specific surface area (SSA) of coarse-textured soils. Detailed physicochemical properties of 40 upland forest mineral soils from northeastern Alberta were used to evaluate three texture-based PTFs and to calculate weathering rates using a process-oriented soil chemical model. Evaluation of the PTFs demonstrated that these equations predict only across a limited range of (low) surface areas. Moreover, the fit between predicted and measured SSA was generally poor for soils in this region of Alberta. Improved prediction of SSA was possible using a texture-based PTF calibrated for the region, although differences between measured and predicted values were often large. Mineralogy terms were used in a more comprehensive PTF to account for mineral-specific differences in surface area. This approach proved superior to texture-only approaches; however, it could not be used reliably for site-specific predictions (NRMSE = 0.41). Soil-chemical model-generated weathering rates were strongly influenced by the SSA method used in parameterization; weathering estimates and corresponding critical load assessments based on measured SSA (and to a lesser extent SSA derived from the regional PTF) were the most robust. Methods for SSA prediction should be used with caution, particularly in cases where they are applied to soils with different character than those for which they were developed},

abstract = {1 A common concern in hydrologic modeling is overparameterization of complex models given limited and noisy data. This leads to problems of parameter nonuniqueness and equifinality, which may negatively affect prediction uncertainties. A systematic way of controlling model complexity is therefore needed. We compare three model complexity control methods for hydrologic prediction, namely, cross validation (CV), Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and structural risk minimization (SRM). Results show that simulation of water flow using non-physically-based models (polynomials in this case) leads to increasingly better calibration fits as the model complexity (polynomial order) increases. However, prediction uncertainty worsens for complex non-physically-based models because of overfitting of noisy data. Incorporation of physically based constraints into the model (e.g., storage-discharge relationship) effectively bounds prediction uncertainty, even as the number of parameters increases. The conclusion is that overparameterization and equifinality do not lead to a continued increase in prediction uncertainty, as long as models are constrained by such physical principles. Complexity control of hydrologic models reduces parameter equifinality and identifies the simplest model that adequately explains the data, thereby providing a means of hydrologic generalization and classification. SRM is a promising technique for this purpose, as it (1) provides analytic upper bounds on prediction uncertainty, hence avoiding the computational burden of CV, and (2) extends the applicability of classic methods such as AIC to finite data. The main hurdle in applying SRM is the need for an a priori estimation of the complexity of the hydrologic model, as measured by its Vapnik-Chernovenkis (VC) dimension. Further research is needed in this area.},

abstract = {Agroforestry is recognized as a strategy for soil carbon sequestration (SCS) under the afforestation/reforestation activities, but our understanding of soil carbon (C) dynamics under agroforestry systems (AFS) is not adequate. Although some SCS estimates are available, many of them lack scientific rigor. Several interrelated and site-specific factors ranging from agroecological conditions to system management practices influence the rate and extent of SCS under AFS, so that generalizations tend to become unrealistic. Furthermore, widely and easily adoptable methodologies are not available for estimating the SCS potential under different conditions. In spite of these, there is an increasing demand for developing "best-bet estimates" based on the current level of knowledge and experience. This document presents an attempt in that direction. The appraisal validates the conjecture that AFS can contribute to SCS, and presents indicative ranges of SCS under different AFS in the major agroecological regions of the tropics. The suggested values range from 5 to 10 kg C ha-1 in about 25 years in extensive tree-intercropping systems of arid and semiarid lands to 100-250 kg C ha-1 in about 10 years in species-intensive multistrata shaded perennial systems and homegardens of humid tropics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Approximately half of the tropical biome is in some stage of recovery from past human disturbance, most of which is in secondary forests growing on abandoned agricultural lands and pastures. Reforestation of these abandoned lands, both natural and managed, has been proposed as a means to help offset increasing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the potential of these forests to serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide in aboveground biomass and soils. A review of literature data shows that aboveground biomass increases at a rate of 6.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years of succession, and at a rate of 2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the first 80 years of regrowth. During the first 20 years of regrowth, forests in wet life zones have the fastest rate of aboveground carbon accumulation with reforestation, followed by dry and moist forests. Soil carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over a 100-year period, and at faster rates during the first 20 years (1.30 Mg carbon ha(-1) yr(-1)). Past land use affects the rate of both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. Forests growing on abandoned agricultural land accumulate biomass faster than other past land uses, while soil carbon accumulates faster on sites that were cleared but not developed, and on pasture sites. Our results indicate that tropical reforestation has the potential to serve as a carbon offset mechanism both above- and belowground for at least 40 to 80 years, and possibly much longer. More research is needed to determine the potential for longer-term carbon sequestration for mitigation of atmospheric CO2 emissions.},

A primary control on soil CO2 flux is the efficiency with which the microbial community uses C. Despite its critical importance to soil–atmosphere CO2 exchange, relatively few studies have examined the factors controlling soil microbial efficiency. Here, we measured the temperature response of microbial efficiency in soils amended with substrates varying in lability. We also examined the temperature sensitivity of microbial efficiency in response to chronic soil warming in situ. We find that the efficiency with which soil microorganisms use organic matter is dependent on both temperature and substrate quality, with efficiency declining with increasing temperatures for more recalcitrant substrates. However, the utilization efficiency of a more recalcitrant substrate increased at higher temperatures in soils exposed to almost two decades of warming 5 ◦C above ambient. Our work suggests that climate warming could alter the decay dynamics of more stable organic matter compounds, thereby having a positive feedback to climate that is attenu- ated by a shift towards a more efficient microbial community in the longer term.},

Empirical data from long-term field experiments in Sweden, two sites with Norway spruce and two with Scots pine with different levels of productivity, were used to calibrate the model against the stem-only treatment. The highest initial reduction in soil C, N and Ca stores was predicted for SSlSt, and the reduction was more pronounced at low productive sites than at the high productive ones. Most of the decline in soil C and Ca stocks was offset by the litter production in the following forest stand. N showed an initial phase of immobilisation in stumps and coarse roots, while N was immediately released from tops and branches, which contained N-rich needles. Removal of stumps and coarse roots in combination with slash resulted in a similar load of inorganic soil N as for the S treatment, whereas the SSl treatment with stumps left in the soil initially reduced the inorganic soil N pool. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate plant available water were developed from a database of arable soils in Sweden. The PTFs were developed to fulfil the minimum requirements of any agro-hydrological application, i.e., soil water content at wilting point ($\theta$wp) and field capacity ($\theta$fc), from information that frequently is available from soil surveys such as texture and soil organic carbon content (SOC). From the same variables we also estimated bulk density ($\rho$) and porosity ($\epsilon$), which seldom are included in surveys, but are needed for calculating element mass balances. The seven particle-size classes given in the data set were aggregated in different ways to match information commonly gained from surveys. Analysis of covariance and stepwise multiple linear regression were used for quantifying the influence of depth, particle size class, textural class and soil organic carbon on the characteristic variables. PTFs developed from other data sets were also tested and their goodness-of-fit and bias was evaluated. These functions and those developed for the Swedish database were also tested on an independent data set and finally ranked according to their goodness of fit. Among single independent variables, clay was the best predictor for $\theta$wp, sand (or the sum of clay and silt) for $\theta$fc and SOC for $\rho$ and $\epsilon$. A large fraction of the variation in $\theta$wp and $\theta$fc is explained by soil texture and SOC (up to 90%) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) were as small as 0.03 m3 water m−3 soil in the best models. For the prediction of $\rho$ and $\epsilon$ in the test data set, the best PTF could only explain 40–43% of the total variance with corresponding RMSEs of 0.14 g cm−3 and 5.3% by volume, respectively. Recently presented PTFs derived from a North American database performed very well for estimating $\theta$wp (low error and bias) and could be recommended for Swedish soils if measurements of clay, sand and SOC were available. Although somewhat less accurately, also $\theta$fc could be estimated satisfactorily. This indicates that the determination of plant available water by texture and SOC is rather independent of soil genesis and that certain PTFs are transferable between continents},

abstract = {Silvopastoral systems can contribute to the mitigation of climate change by functioning as sinks for greenhouse gases better than exclusively agricultural systems. Tree species, density, and an adequate management of the pasture carrying capacity contribute to the capacity of carbon sequestration. In this study, the capacities for carbon sequestration in silvopastoral systems that were established with two different forest species (Pinus radiata D. Don and Betula alba L.) and at two distinct densities (833 and 2500 trees ha-1) were evaluated. Tree, litterfall, pasture and soil carbon storage determinations were carried out to deliver carbon sequestration in the different pools within the first 11 years of a plantation establishment. The results show that the global capacity for carbon sequestration in silvopastoral systems with pine canopy was higher than with birch cover. Independently of the forest species, the capacity for carbon sequestration increased when the systems were established at higher plantation densities. There were found strong differences in the relative proportions of carbon in each component of the system (litterfall, tree, pasture and soil). The soil component was found to be most important in the case of the broadleaf forest established at low density. The establishment of a silvopastoral system enhanced soil carbon storage, since afforestation was carried out, which results in a more enduring storage capacity compared with treeless areas. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

They also support the concept of long cyclic changes in natural stands, gradually approaching a climax state.

abstract = {Global ecosystem models may require microbial components to accurately predict feedbacks between climate warming and soil decomposition, but it is unclear what parameters and levels of complexity are ideal for scaling up to the globe. Here we conducted a model comparison using a conventional model with first-order decay and three microbial models of increasing complexity that simulate short- to long-term soil carbon dynamics. We focused on soil carbon responses to microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and temperature. Three scenarios were implemented in all models: constant CUE (held at 0.31), varied CUE (-0.016 A degrees C-1), and 50 % acclimated CUE (-0.008 A degrees C-1). Whereas the conventional model always showed soil carbon losses with increasing temperature, the microbial models each predicted a temperature threshold above which warming led to soil carbon gain. The location of this threshold depended on CUE scenario, with higher temperature thresholds under the acclimated and constant scenarios. This result suggests that the temperature sensitivity of CUE and the structure of the soil carbon model together regulate the long-term soil carbon response to warming. Equilibrium soil carbon stocks predicted by the microbial models were much less sensitive to changing inputs compared to the conventional model. Although many soil carbon dynamics were similar across microbial models, the most complex model showed less pronounced oscillations. Thus, adding model complexity (i.e. including enzyme pools) could improve the mechanistic representation of soil carbon dynamics during the transient phase in certain ecosystems. This study suggests that model structure and CUE parameterization should be carefully evaluated when scaling up microbial models to ecosystems and the globe.},

abstract = {Most changes in land use affect the amount of carbon held in vegetation and soil, thereby, either releasing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to, or removing it from, the atmosphere. The greatest fluxes of carbon result from conversion of forests to open lands (and vice versa). Model-based estimates of the flux of carbon attributable to land-use change are highly variable, however, largely as a result of uncertainties in the areas annually affected by different types of land-use change. Uncertain rates of tropical deforestation, for example, account for more than half of the range in estimates of the global carbon flux. Three other factors account for much of the rest of the uncertainty: (1) the initial stocks of carbon in ecosystems affected by land-use change (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), (2) per hectare changes in carbon stocks in response to different types of land-use change, and (3) legacy effects; that is, the time it takes for carbon stocks to equilibrate following a change in land use. For the tropics, recent satellite-based estimates of deforestation are lower than previous estimates and yield calculated carbon emissions from land-use change that are similar to independently-derived estimates of the total net flux for the region. The similarity suggests that changes in land use account for the net flux of carbon from the tropics. For the northern mid-latitudes, the carbon sink attributed to land-use change is less than the sink obtained by other methods, suggesting either an incomplete accounting of land-use change or the importance of other factors in explaining the current carbon sink in that region.},

abstract = {The study of the fate of assimilated carbon in respiratory fluxes in the field is needed to resolve the residence and transfer times of carbon in the atmosphere-plant-soil system in forest ecosystems, but it requires high frequency measurements of the isotopic composition of evolved CO2. We developed a closed transparent chamber to label the whole crown of a tree and a labelling system capable of delivering a 3-h pulse of 99% 13CO2 in the field. The isotopic compositions of trunk and soil CO2 effluxes were recorded continuously on two labelled and one control trees by a tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometer during a 2-month chase period following the late summer labelling. The lag times for trunk CO2 effluxes are consistent with a phloem sap velocity of about 1 m h(-1). The isotopic composition (delta13C) of CO2 efflux from the trunk was maximal 2-3 days after labelling and declined thereafter following two exponential decays with a half-life of 2-8 days for the first and a half-life of 15-16 days for the second. The isotopic composition of the soil CO2 efflux was maximal 3-4 days after labelling and the decline was also well fitted with a sum of two exponential functions with a half-life of 3-5 days for the first exponential and a half-life of 16-18 days for the second. The amount of label recovered in CO2 efflux was around 10-15% of the assimilated 13CO2 for soil and 5-13% for trunks. As labelling occurred late in the growing season, substantial allocation to storage is expected.},

Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year(-1)) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year(-1) from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year(-1) partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year(-1). Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year(-1), with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

abstract = {Soils are highly variable at many spatial scales, which makes designing studies to accurately estimate the mean value of soil properties across space challenging. The spatial correlation structure is critical to develop robust sampling strategies (e.g., sample size and sample spacing). Current guidelines for designing studies recommend conducting preliminary investigation(s) to characterize this structure, but are rarely followed and sampling designs are often defined by logistics rather than quantitative considerations. The spatial variability of soils was assessed across ∼1 ha at 60 sites. Sites were chosen to represent key US ecosystems as part of a scaling strategy deployed by the National Ecological Observatory Network. We measured soil temperature (Ts) and water content (SWC) because these properties mediate biological/biogeochemical processes below- and above-ground, and quantified spatial variability using semivariograms to estimate spatial correlation. We developed quantitative guidelines to inform sample size and sample spacing for future soil studies, e.g., 20 samples were sufficient to measure Ts to within 10% of the mean with 90% confidence at every temperate and sub-tropical site during the growing season, whereas an order of magnitude more samples were needed to meet this accuracy at some high-latitude sites. SWC was significantly more variable than Ts at most sites, resulting in at least 10× more SWC samples needed to meet the same accuracy requirement. Previous studies investigated the relationship between the mean and variability (i.e., sill) of SWC across space at individual sites across time and have often (but not always) observed the variance or standard deviation peaking at intermediate values of SWC and decreasing at low and high SWC. Finally, we quantified how far apart samples must be spaced to be statistically independent. Semivariance structures from 10 of the 12-dominant soil orders across the US were estimated, advancing our continental-scale understanding of soil behavior.},

The major current challenge is to validate mechanistic descriptions of microbial processes and predicted system responses against experimental observations. We analyzed soil biochemical models of different complexity regarding parameter identifiability using information geometry, i.e. a model is geometrically interpreted as a manifold embedded in data space. The most complex model (PECCAD) was used as a test case to reveal parsimonious process formulations. All models showed sloppiness, i.e. most individual parameter values cannot be inferred from the observed data. We derived a less complex model formulation of PECCAD with effective inferable parameter combinations and identified structural model limitations. The complexity of identified effective models was systematically reduced with decreasing information content of data. Our results suggest that information geometry provides a powerful approach to derive effective descriptions of relevant biogeochemical processes and reduce structural model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Land use is a critical factor in the global carbon cycle, but land-use effects on carbon fluxes are poorly understood in many regions. One such region is Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where land-use intensity decreased substantially after the collapse of socialism, and farmland abandonment and forest expansion have been widespread. Our goal was to examine how land-use trends affected net carbon fluxes in western Ukraine (57,000km2) and to assess the region's future carbon sequestration potential. Using satellite-based forest disturbance and farmland abandon- ment rates from 1988 to 2007, historic forest resource statistics, and a carbon bookkeeping model, we reconstructed carbon fluxes from land use in the 20th century and assessed potential future carbon fluxes until 2100 for a range of forest expansion and logging scenarios. Our results suggested that the low-point in forest cover occurred in the 1920s. Forest expansion between 1930 and 1970 turned the region from a carbon source to a sink, despite intensive logging during socialism. The collapse of the Soviet Union created a vast, but currently largely untapped carbon sequestration potential (up to $\sim$150TgC in our study region). Future forest expansion will likely maintain or even increase the region's current sink strength of 1.48TgCyr-1. This may offer substantial opportunities for offsetting industrial carbon emissions and for rural development in regions with otherwise diminishing income opportunities. Through- out Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, millions of hectares of farmland were abandoned after the collapse of socialism; thus similar reforestation opportunities may exist in other parts of this region.},

Soil Biology & Biochemistry 40, 61-73) recently proposed the "Regulatory Gate" hypothesis, which states that decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is regulated solely by abiotic factors. Without studying the mechanisms of such regulation, Kemmitt with coauthors challenged the classical Winogradsky theory of soil microbiology and questioned the concept of autochtonous and zymogenous microbial populations. In this letter, we revive the significance of microbial activity for SOM decomposition especially for the short-term (hours to weeks) processes and show that the "Regulatory Gate" is (micro)biologically driven. We explain the results of the three experiments in Kemmitt et??al. (2008) from a microbiological point of view and suggest that SOM decomposition is mainly regulated by exoenzymes. We criticize the abiotic Regulatory Gate hypothesis based on bottleneck processes and pools limiting the SOM decomposition rate, comparison of constant and changing environmental conditions, as well as the connection between community structure and functions. We explain the results of Kemmitt et??al. (2008) according to the properties of soil microbial community: functional redundancy and inconsistency between the excessive (but largely inactive) pool of total microbial biomass and the real mineralization activity. Finally, we suggest that to gain new perspectives on SOM decomposition and many other biochemical processes, future studies should focus on hot spots of (micro)biological activity (i.e., the rhizosphere, drillosphere, detritosphere, biopores, etc.) rather than on the bulk soil. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fine roots (diameter <2 mm) have a pivotal role in resource acquisition, symbiosis development, and for elemental cycling in forests. Various abiotic and biotic factors affect their biomass and nutrient content. Understanding the effect of these factors on root traits could improve biogeochemical modelling, nutrient management and ecosystem services provision in planted forests. Data from 14-year old poplars planted along a fertility/climatic gradient in Southeastern Canada, show that live fine root biomass varied with genotype and environment, was negatively correlated to soil fertility, and uncorrelated to tree size. Dead fine root biomass varied with genotype and peaked during fall and in colder environments with slower element cycling. Root chemistry also varied with environment, genotype and season. The genotype producing recalcitrant leaf litter had the highest root biomass, suggesting a compensation strategy. Along the studied gradient, plasticity level observed for some root traits (biomass, element contents) was genotype-specific and high for some genotypes. Regionally, such plasticity patterns should be considered in elemental budgets, for nutrient management and ecosystem services provision in plantations (carbon storage, nutrient retention). The small inter-site aboveground productivity differences observed suggest that plasticity in fine root growth may contribute to overcome nutrient limitations on less fertile marginal lands.},

abstract = {The farm-level model Holos, developed to explore mitigation options for greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from Canadian farming systems, includes soil carbon change as a prominent component. Soil carbon was assumed to be constant, except where there was recent change in land use or management (e.g., conventional vs. reduced vs. no tillage). The factors associated with the changes were derived using CENTURY model simulations. To make Holos more responsive to farm management (e.g., crop rotation and residue management) and inter-annual climate variation, it was decided to replace the carbon change factors with the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM), a simple two carbon pool model driven by inputs from above- and belowground crop residues and manure. We showcase how the model will simulate the impact of crop rotation management decisions on soil carbon change, focussing on the choice of crop and crop residue retention, but considering also tillage and fertilization management. We argue that simulating carbon change at each field involved in the rotation is advantageous because it allows to test the rotation resilience with respect to inter-annual climate variation as well as to validate the model outputs using measurements of scientific long-term field experiments. We propose to report the farm-level carbon change results ranging from annual to centennial time frames which would be in line with the reporting requirements in carbon credit programs, while giving the user the capability to project and test new crop rotation systems using long-term carbon change forecasts.},

abstract = {The first radiocarbon dating was performed in 1949 (Libby et al, 1949). At that time, and up until 1977, all radiocarbon measurements were performed by measuring the radioactive decay of 14C. Since then accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) has entered the scene. AMS relies on counting the relative abundance directly in terms of isotope ratios. Even if only working with AMS, it is difficult to avoid the concept of activity measurement, as most definitions of the jungle of quantities and units that are used in radiocarbon measurements stems from the early days of radiocarbon dating. In this paper we will review the basic calculations used in radiocarbon measurements and we will try to summarize the different quantities and units used. Unfortunately, some quantities have more than one definition, and we will make recommendations of how to use the different expressions.},

abstract = {Growth substrates that maximize energy yield are widely thought to be utilized preferentially by microorganisms. However, observed distributions of microorganisms and their activities often deviate from predictions based solely on thermodynamic considerations of substrate energy supply. Here we present observations of the bioenergetics and growth yields of a metabolically flexible, thermophilic strain of the archaeon Acidianus when grown autotrophically on minimal medium with hydrogen (H 2) or elemental sulfur (S •) as an electron donor, and S • or ferric iron (Fe 3+) as an electron acceptor. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that S • /Fe 3+ and H 2 /Fe 3+ yield three-and fourfold more energy per mole of electrons transferred, respectively, than the H 2 /S • couple. However, biomass yields in Acidianus cultures provided with H 2 /S • were eightfold greater than when provided S • /Fe 3+ or H 2 /Fe 3+ , indicating that the H 2 /S • redox couple is preferred. Indeed, cells provided with all three growth substrates (H 2 , Fe 3+ and S •) grew preferentially by reduction of S • with H 2 . We conclude that substrate preference is dictated by diierences in the energy demand of electron transfer reactions in Acidianus when grown with diierent substrates, rather than substrate energy supply. M icroorganisms and their activities drive global biogeo-chemical cycles and interconnect ecosystem processes af-fecting plant, animal and human health 1,2 . Consequently, a central goal in microbial ecology is to predict the distributions and activities of microorganisms in natural environments 3 . The applica-tion of thermodynamic calculations to geochemical data makes it possible to predict and infer the variety and abundance of chemical energy available to microbial populations 4,5 . Such approaches have been widely used to rationalize the observed distribution of micro-bial populations and their activities in a variety of environments 6–8 . Thermodynamic-based approaches rank assemblages of redox reactions according to the amount of energy that can be dissipated, with the distribution of microorganisms and their activities pre-sumed to follow this sequence of reactions due to competition for energy-rich substrates 6,7,9,10 . However, thermodynamic-based pre-dictions often fall short of accurately describing the distribution of microorganisms and metabolic processes in natural 11–14 and en-gineered systems 15 . To provide insight into why these predictions often fail to play out in natural systems and to improve our ability to accurately predict patterns of substrate usage and their effects on biogeochemical cycles, we aimed to quantify the bioenergetics and biomass yields of a metabolically versatile organism. To limit the influence of confounding variables in our determination of the efficiency of biomass synthesis, we sought to identify an autotrophic strain with the ability to grow on defined mineral medium with minimal biosynthetic deficiencies (minimal auxotrophy) and that exhibits versatility in its energy metabolism. The thermoacidophilic strain Acidianus DS80, within the cre-narchaeal order Sulfolobales, was isolated under autotrophic con-ditions on defined mineral medium (supplemented with vitamins) from 'Dragon Spring' (pH 3.1, 78 • C), Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Strain DS80 displays versatility in lithotrophic energy metabolism involving hydrogen (H 2) or elemental sulfur (S •) as electron donors and S • or ferric iron (Fe 3+) as electron acceptors (Supplementary Fig. 1) when grown at pH 3.0 and 80 • C. Moreover, the ability of strain DS80 to couple the iron, sulfur and hydrogen cycles in overlapping ways, in addition to the broader metabolic flexibility and global distribution of Acidianus in thermal environ-ments 16–18 , makes strain DS80 a good model system to examine factors that influence substrate preference.},

However, most studies either focused on national and supra-national scales or on the project level in the context of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. Few studies are available which analyze the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies on carbon sequestration, timber production and other forest services and functions at the operational level of the forest management unit (FMU). The present study investigates effects of three alternative management strategies for secondary Norway spruce forests (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (Norway spruce age class forestry; continuous cover forestry; conversion to mixed broadleaved forests) and an unmanaged control variant on C sequestration in situ, in wood products and through bioenergy production at the level of a private FMU in Austria, and analyses the interrelationships with timber production and key indicators of biodiversity. The hybrid patch model PICUS v1.4 and a wood products model are employed to simulate forest ecosystem development, timber production, carbon storage in the forest and in wood product pools. Results show that in situ C sequestration is sensitive to forest management with the highest amount of carbon stored in the unmanaged strategy, followed by the continuous cover regime. All three management strategies store substantial quantities of C in the wood products pool. Considering alternative biomass utilization focused on bioenergy production, substantial C offsets could be generated from potential substitution of fossil fuels. Opportunity cost estimates for C sequestration reveal that C sequestration through forest management can be a cost efficient way to reduce atmospheric CO2, but the achievable quantities are limited due to biological limitations and societal constraints. The study emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable forest management strategies that serve the multiple demands on forests in the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Microbial biomass is a small part of the total soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, but plays a major role in its turnover. A field experiment in Sweden, amended with different mineral and organic materials since 1956, was changed from continuous C3 plants to C4 vegetation (silage maize) in 2000. In 2012, soil samples from three fertilizer treatments (calcium nitrate, calcium nitrate plus straw and sewage sludge) and two controls (bare fallow and cropped unfertilized) were taken on three occasions (before, during and after cropping). Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were extracted from all soil samples and analysed for 12C and 13C contents in individual PLFAs. Seasonal variation in total PLFAs was small except for the most SOC-rich treatment (sewage sludge). Weighted means of $\delta$13C in PLFAs showed that the plots fertilized with calcium nitrate only had the largest $\delta$13C values in PLFAs before (−20.24‰) and after the vegetation period (−20.37‰). However, during the vegetation period the values were much smaller (−21.85‰). This coincided with a strong increase in the PLFA 18:2$\omega$6,9, indicating the use of old organic matter by fungi. Monounsaturated PLFAs indicative of Gram-negative bacteria were more frequent before and after the growing season. This observed ‘rebound' effect of the $\delta$13C PLFA values during the vegetation period indicates that seasonal turnover of the microbial biomass can be substantial.},

abstract = {The influence of pH on the relative importance of the two principal decomposer groups in soil, fungi and bacteria, was investigated along a continuous soil pH gradient at Hoosfield acid strip at Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom. This experimental location provides a uniform pH gradient, ranging from pH 8.3 to 4.0, within 180 m in a silty loam soil on which barley has been continuously grown for more than 100 years. We estimated the importance of fungi and bacteria directly by measuring acetate incorporation into ergosterol to measure fungal growth and leucine and thymidine incorporation to measure bacterial growth. The growth-based measurements revealed a fivefold decrease in bacterial growth and a fivefold increase in fungal growth with lower pH. This resulted in an approximately 30-fold increase in fungal importance, as indicated by the fungal growth/bacterial growth ratio, from pH 8.3 to pH 4.5. In contrast, corresponding effects on biomass markers for fungi (ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] 18:2omega6,9) and bacteria (bacterial PLFAs) showed only a two- to threefold difference in fungal importance in the same pH interval. The shift in fungal and bacterial importance along the pH gradient decreased the total carbon mineralization, measured as basal respiration, by only about one-third, possibly suggesting functional redundancy. Below pH 4.5 there was universal inhibition of all microbial variables, probably derived from increased inhibitory effects due to release of free aluminum or decreasing plant productivity. To investigate decomposer group importance, growth measurements provided significantly increased sensitivity compared with biomass-based measurements.},

abstract = {A reliable model for any wastewater treatment plant is essential in order to provide a tool for predicting its performance and to form a basis for controlling the operation of the process. This would minimize the operation costs and assess the stability of environmental balance. This process is complex and attains a high degree of nonlinearity due to the presence of bio-organic constituents that are difficult to model using mechanistic approaches. Predicting the plant operational parameters using conventional experimental techniques is also a time consuming step and is an obstacle in the way of efficient control of such processes. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) black-box modeling approach was used to acquire the knowledge base of a real wastewater plant and then used as a process model. The study signifies that the ANNs are capable of capturing the plant operation characteristics with a good degree of accuracy. A computer model is developed that incorporates the trained ANN plant model. The developed program is implemented and validated using plant-scale data obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant, namely the Doha West wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). It is used as a valuable performance assessment tool for plant operators and decision makers. The ANN model provided accurate predictions of the effluent stream, in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) when using COD as an input in the crude supply stream. It can be said that the ANN predictions based on three crude supply inputs together, namely BOD, COD and TSS, resulted in better ANN predictions when using only one crude supply input. Graphical user interface representation of the ANN for the Doha West WWTP data is performed and presented.},

abstract = {Land-use change (LUC) is a major driving factor for the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the global carbon cycle. The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30±6cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128±23% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116±54%, 100 years after LUC (mean±95% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38±0.04Mgha-1yr-1 in afforestations adding up to 38±4Mgha-1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (-32±20%) and grassland conversion to cropland (-36±5%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25±5% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {<p>A number of nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition have been developed. Some of them have been applied globally but have yet to be shown to realistically represent soil carbon dynamics in the field. Therefore a thorough analysis of their key differences will be very useful for the future development of these models. Here we compare two nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition: one is based on reverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics (model A) and the other on regular Michaelis-Menten kinetics (model B). Using a combination of analytic solutions and numerical simulations, we find that the oscillatory responses of carbon pools model A to a small perturbation in the initial pool sizes have a higher frequency and damps faster than model B. In response to soil warming, soil carbon always decreases in model A; but likely decreases in cool regions and increases in warm regions in model B. Maximum CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from soil carbon decomposition (<i>F</i><sub>max</sub>) after an increased carbon addition decreases with an increase in soil temperature in both models, and the sensitivity of <i>F</i><sub>max</sub> to the amount of carbon input increases with soil temperature in model A; but decreases monotonically with an increase in soil temperature in model B. These differences in the responses to soil warming and carbon input between the two nonlinear models can be used to differentiate which model is more realistic with field or laboratory experiments. This will lead to a better understanding of the significance of soil microbial processes in the responses of soil carbon to future climate change at regional or global scales.</p>},

abstract = {• Photosynthetic carbon (C) isotope discrimination ($\Delta$(Α)) labels photosynthates ($\delta$(A) ) and atmospheric CO(2) ($\delta$(a)) with variable C isotope compositions during fluctuating environmental conditions. In this context, the C isotope composition of respired CO(2) within ecosystems is often hypothesized to vary temporally with $\Delta$(Α). • We investigated the relationship between $\Delta$(Α) and the C isotope signals from stem ($\delta$(W)), soil ($\delta$(S)) and ecosystem ($\delta$(E)) respired CO(2) to environmental fluctuations, using novel tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometer instrumentation in a mature maritime pine forest. • Broad seasonal changes in $\Delta$(Α) were reflected in $\delta$(W,) $\delta$(S) and $\delta$(E). However, respired CO(2) signals had smaller short-term variations than $\Delta$(A) and were offset and delayed by 2-10 d, indicating fractionation and isotopic mixing in a large C pool. Variations in $\delta$(S) did not follow $\Delta$(A) at all times, especially during rainy periods and when there is a strong demand for C allocation above ground. • It is likely that future isotope-enabled vegetation models will need to develop transfer functions that can account for these phenomena in order to interpret and predict the isotopic impact of biosphere gas exchange on the C isotope composition of atmospheric CO(2).},

abstract = {The paper studies the radiation and diffraction by floating bodies of deep-water bichromatic and bidirectional surface waves subject to the second-order free-surface condition. A theory is developed for the evaluation of the second-order velocity potential and wave forces valid for bodies of arbitrary geometry, which does not involve the evaluation of integrals over the free surface or require an increased accuracy in the solution of the linear problem. Explicit sum and difference-frequency ‘Green functions' are derived for the radiation and diffraction problems, obtained from the solution of initial-value problems that ensure they satisfy the proper radiation condition at infinity. The second-order velocity potential is expressed as the sum of a particular and a homogeneous component. The former satisfies the non-homogeneous free-surface condition and is expressed explicitly in terms of the second-order Green functions. The latter is subject to the homogeneous free-surface condition and enforces the body boundary condition by the solution of a linear problem. An analysis is carried out of the singular behaviour of the second-order potential near the intersection of the body boundary with the free surface. {\textcopyright} 1988, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {The plant-available pools of calcium, magnesium and potassium are assumed to be stored in the soil as exchangeable cations adsorbed on the cation exchange complex. In numerous forest ecosystems, despite very low plant-available pools, elevated forest productivities are sustained. We hypothesize that trees access nutrient sources in the soil that are currently unaccounted by conventional soil analysis methods. We carried out an isotopic dilution assay to quantify the plant-available pools of calcium, magnesium and potassium and trace the soil phases that support these pools in 143 individual soil samples covering 3 climatic zones and 5 different soil types. For 81%, 87% and 90% of the soil samples (respectively for Ca, Mg and K), the plant-available pools measured by isotopic dilution were greater than the conventional exchangeable pool. This additional pool is most likely supported by secondary non-crystalline mineral phases in interaction with soil organic matter and represents in many cases (respectively 43%, 27% and 47% of the soil samples) a substantial amount of plant-available nutrient cations (50% greater than the conventional exchangeable pools) that is likely to play an essential role in the biogeochemical functioning of forest ecosystems, in particular when the resources of Ca, Mg and K are low.},

abstract = {Phenol oxidases (POs) are a group of soil extracellular oxidoreductase enzymes, which are involved in oxidative processes related to nutrient cycling. This class of enzymes has multiple functions at both the organism and ecosystem level and can trigger either positive or negative feedback loops between soil organisms and soil organic matter. The purpose of this study was to evaluate: (i) whether PO activities have a trend different from those of microbial biomass and activity; and (ii) whether PO activities are enhanced or reduced by fertilizer application. Soil samples were taken from plots in a 14-year-old experimental walnut orchard, subjected, since planting, to three fertilizer treatments: organic (compost) or mineral (urea) fertilization at the same rate of nitrogen application (100 kg N ha− 1), or left unfertilized. Soil samples were divided according to sampling depth (0–20 cm and 20–40 cm). Results showed that the application of compost significantly increased C and N pools. qCO2 and DHD/Cext data indicated that the biota at 20–40 cm soil depth was more stressed or mainly composed of microorganisms with low substrate utilization efficiency. Phenol oxidase, tyrosinase, and catechol oxidase activities were significantly promoted in the surface layer by compost addition. In contrast, laccase activity showed a large increase in the deeper soil layer when supplied with mineral N, whereas compost addition led to increased activity in the surface layer. These findings suggest that soil phenol oxidases play a part in the determination of soil functionality, but they need to be investigated in greater depth in order to understand the mechanisms regulating their activities.},

Having been used to study the dynamics of forests all over the world, the Matrix model is thriving in forestry, with applications covering a wide array of areas. Despite its extensive application in forestry, the Matrix model is still suffering from a lack of due attention and appropriate understanding, especially on its advantages and limitations in comparison with those of other forest dynamics models. To facilitate further research and applications, a synthetic review of Matrix models is provided here with an emphasis on its mathematical properties and relationship with other forest dynamics models. In this article, we first introduce the general structure of Matrix models and its representation of forest dynamics components, i.e., upgrowth, mortality, and recruitment. Then, we summarize key properties of Matrix models, including basic assumptions, density dependence, size class width and time step, and the estimation of forest dynamics components will be summarized. Next, we evaluate advantages and limitations of the Matrix model and its relationship with other forest dynamics models. Finally, we share our perspective on the major challenges and future outlooks of Matrix models. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Society of American Foresters.},

Therefore, any small change in the amount of soil organic C (SOC) may affect carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. Dynamic models of SOC help reveal the interaction among soil carbon systems, climate and land management, and they are also frequently used to help assess SOC dynamics. Those models often use allometric functions to calculate soil C inputs in which the amount of C in both above and below ground crop residues are assumed to be proportional to crop harvest yield. Here we argue that simulating changes in SOC stocks based on C input that are proportional to crop yield is not supported by data from long-term experiments with measured SOC changes. Rather, there is evidence that root C inputs are largely independent of crop yield, but crop specific. We discuss implications of applying fixed belowground C input regardless of crop yield on agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation and accounting.},

abstract = {Previous analysis of the vegetation cover from remote sensing revealed the existence of three alternative modes in the frequency distribution of boreal tree cover: a sparsely vegetated treeless state, an open woodland state, and a forest state. Identifying which are the regions subject to multimodality, and assessing which are the main factors underlying their existence, is important to project future change of natural vegetation cover and its effect on climate. We study the link between the tree-cover fraction distribution and eight globally observed environmental factors: mean annual rainfall, mean minimum temperature, growing degree days above 0 °C, permafrost distribution, mean spring soil moisture, wildfire occurrence frequency, soil texture, and mean thawing depth. Through the use of generalised additive models, conditional histograms, and phase-space analysis, we find that environmental conditions exert a strong control over the tree-cover distribution, uniquely determining its state among the three dominant modes in 95% of the cases. Additionally, we find that the link between individual environmental variables and tree cover is different within the four boreal regions considered here, namely eastern North Eurasia, western North Eurasia, eastern North America, and western North America. Furthermore, using a classification based on rainfall, minimum temperatures, permafrost distribution, soil moisture, wildfire frequency, and soil texture, we show the location of areas with potentially alternative tree-cover states under the same environmental conditions in the boreal region. These areas, although encompassing a minor fraction of the boreal area (5%), correspond to possible transition zones with a reduced resilience to disturbances. Hence, they are of interest for a more detailed analysis of land-atmosphere interactions.},

abstract = {Global change is altering species distributions and thus interactions among organisms. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, some beneficial, some pathogenic, some which have little to no effect in complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability it is unlikely they will all respond to climatic change in a similar way. Disjuncts in plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions under global change have been relatively well described, but plant-soil microorganism and soil microbe-microbe relationships have received less attention. Since soil microorganisms regulate nutrient transformations, provide plants with nutrients, allow co-existence among neighbors, and control plant populations, changes in soil microorganism-plant interactions could have significant ramifications for plant community composition and ecosystem function. In this paper we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and soil microbe-plant interactions directly and indirectly, discuss what we see as emerging and exciting questions and areas for future research, and discuss what ramifications changes in these interactions may have on the composition and function of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Soils are a key component of the terrestrial carbon cycle as they contain the majority of terrestrial carbon. Soil microorganisms mainly control the accumu- lation and loss of this carbon. However, traditional con- cepts of soil carbon stabilisation failed so far to account for environmental and energetic constraints of microorgan- isms. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that these biological limitations might have the overall control on soil carbon stability. In a long-term experiment, we incubated 13C-labelled compost with natural soils at various soil carbon concentrations. Unexpectedly, we found that soil carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentra- tion. We developed a conceptual model that explained these observations. In this model, two types of particles were submitted to random walk movement in the soil profile: soil organic matter substrate and microbial decomposers. Soil carbon turnover depended only on the likelihood of a decomposer particle to meet a substrate particle; in consequence, carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration, like observed in the experi- ment. This conceptual model was able to simulate realistic depth profiles of soil carbon and soil carbon age. Our results, which are simply based on the application of a two- step kinetic, unmystify the stability of soil carbon and suggest that observations like high carbon ages in subsoil, stability of carbon in fallows and priming of soil carbon might be simply explained by the probability to be decomposed.},

abstract = {Sustainable and resilient agricultural systems are needed to feed and fuel a growing human population. However, the current model of agricultural intensification which produces high yields has also resulted in a loss of biodiversity, ecological function, and critical ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. A key consequence of agricultural intensification is landscape simplification, where once heterogeneous landscapes contain increasingly fewer crop and non-crop habitats. Landscape simplification exacerbates biodiversity losses which leads to reductions in ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. In recent decades, considerable research has focused on mitigating these negative impacts, primarily via management of habitats to promote biodiversity and enhance services at the local scale. While it is well known that local and landscape factors interact, modifying overall landscape structure is seldom considered due to logistical constraints. I propose that the loss of ecosystem services due to landscape simplification can only be addressed by a concerted effort to fundamentally redesign agricultural landscapes. Designing agricultural landscapes will require that scientists work with stakeholders to determine the mix of desired ecosystem services, evaluate current landscape structure in light of those goals, and implement targeted modifications to achieve them. I evaluate the current status of landscape design, ranging from fundamental ecological principles to resulting guidelines and socioeconomic tools. While research gaps remain, the time is right for ecologists to engage with other disciplines, stakeholders, and policymakers in education and advocacy to foster agricultural landscape design for sustainable and resilient biodiversity services.},

abstract = {Soil microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE), which is defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake, is commonly assumed as a constant or estimated by a temperature-dependent function in current microbial-explicit soil carbon (C) models. The temperature-dependent function (i.e., CUE = CUE0 + m × (T − 20)) simulates the dynamic CUE based on the specific CUE at a given reference temperature (i.e., CUE0) and a temperature response coefficient (i.e., m). Here, based on 780 observations from 98 sites, we showed a divergent spatial distribution of the soil microbial CUE (0.5 ± 0.25; mean ± SD) at the global scale. Then, the key parameters CUE0 and m in the above equation were estimated as 0.475 and −0.016, respectively, based on the observations with the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. We also found a strong dependence of microbial CUE on the type of C substrate. The multiple regression analysis showed that glucose influences the variation of measured CUE associated with the environmental factors. Overall, this study confirms the global divergence of soil microbial CUE and calls for the incorporation of C substrate beside temperature in estimating the microbial CUE in different biomes.},

abstract = {Agriculture represents about 11% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe). Many climate change mitigation strategies have been evaluated in Mediterranean agroecosystems, including their soil organic carbon sequestration potential. High residue yielding old varieties could constitute a useful alternative, especially for organic farming, which lacks specific genetic material. In this study, old and modern wheat varieties were evaluated under organic (ORG) and conventional (CON) management during a 3-year field experiment under rainfed Mediterranean conditions. Field measurements of biomass components, literature emission factors, and soil organic carbon modeling were combined in an attributional Life Cycle Assessment, in order to estimate GHGe from “cradle to farm gate”. The resulting yield-based carbon footprints of old wheat varieties were significantly lower than those of modern varieties both under CON management, decreasing from 263 to 144 g CO2e kg−1, and under ORG management, decreasing from 29 to −43 g CO2e kg−1. Our results indicate that climate change mitigation strategies in Mediterranean rainfed cereal cropping systems should focus on diminishing GHGe from machinery and fertilizer use, and promoting carbon sequestration. The combination of organic management and old cereal varieties can constitute a promising climate change mitigation strategy in these systems, as low area-scaled GHGe of organic management are combined with enhanced carbon sequestration and a good yield performance of old varieties under these conditions.},

abstract = {The exchange of carbon between soil organic carbon (SOC) and the atmosphere affects the climate1,2 and—because of the importance of organic matter to soil fertility—agricultural productivity3. The dynamics of topsoil carbon has been relatively well quantified4, but half of the soil carbon is located in deeper soil layers (below 30 centimetres)5–7, and many questions remain regarding the exchange of this deep carbon with the atmosphere8. This knowledge gap restricts soil carbon management policies and limits global carbon models1,9,10. Here we quantify the recent incorporation of atmosphere-derived carbon atoms into whole-soil profiles, through a meta-analysis of changes in stable carbon isotope signatures at 112 grassland, forest and cropland sites, across different climatic zones, from 1965 to 2015. We find, in agreement with previous work5,6, that soil at a depth of 30–100 centimetres beneath the surface (the subsoil) contains on average 47 per cent of the topmost metre's SOC stocks. However, we show that this subsoil accounts for just 19 per cent of the SOC that has been recently incorporated (within the past 50 years) into the topmost metre. Globally, the median depth of recent carbon incorporation into mineral soil is 10 centimetres. Variations in the relative allocation of carbon to deep soil layers are better explained by the aridity index than by mean annual temperature. Land use for crops reduces the incorporation of carbon into the soil surface layer, but not into deeper layers. Our results suggest that SOC dynamics and its responses to climatic control or land use are strongly dependent on soil depth. We propose that using multilayer soil modules in global carbon models, tested with our data, could help to improve our understanding of soil–atmosphere carbon exchange.},

abstract = {To test the reliability of the radiocarbon method for determining root age, we analyzed fine roots (originating from the years 1985-1993) from ingrowth cores with known maximum root age (1-6 years old). For this purpose, three Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were selected from boreal forests in Finland. We analyzed root (14)C age by the radiocarbon method and compared it with the above-mentioned known maximum fine root age. In general, ages determined by the two methods (root (14)C age and ingrowth core root maximum age) were in agreement with each other for roots of small diameter (< 0.5 mm). By contrast, in most of the samples of fine roots of larger diameter (1.5-2 mm), the (14)C age of root samples of 1987-1989 exceeded the ingrowth core root maximum age by 1-10 years. This shows that these roots had received a large amount of older stored carbon from unknown sources in addition to atmospheric CO(2) directly from photosynthesis. We conclude that the (14)C signature of fine roots, especially those of larger diameter, may not always be indicative of root age, and that further studies are needed concerning the extent of possible root uptake of older carbon and its residence time in roots.},

abstract = {The evaluation of hydrologic model behaviour and performance is commonly made and reported through comparisons of simulated and observed variables. Frequently, comparisons are made between simulated and measured streamflow at the catchment outlet. In distributed hydrological modelling approaches, additional comparisons of simulated and observed measurements for multi-response validation may be integrated into the evaluation procedure to assess overall modelling performance. In both approaches, single and multi-response, efficiency criteria are commonly used by hydrologists to provide an objective assessment of the "closeness" of the simulated behaviour to the observed measurements. While there are a few efficiency criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of determination, and index of agreement that are frequently used in hydrologic modeling studies and reported in the literature, there are a large number of other efficiency criteria to choose from. The selection and use of specific efficiency criteria and the interpretation of the results can be a challenge for even the most experienced hydrologist since each criterion may place different emphasis on different types of simulated and observed behaviours. In this paper, the utility of several efficiency criteria is investigated in three examples using a simple observed streamflow hydrograph.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that photosynthesis affects the diurnal pattern of grassland soil-respired CO(2) and its C isotope composition (delta(13)C(SR)). A combined shading and pulse-labelling experiment was carried out in a mountain grassland. delta(13)C(SR) was monitored at a high time resolution with a tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer. In unlabelled plots a diurnal pattern of delta(13)C(SR) was observed, which was not explained by soil temperature, moisture or flux rates and contained a component that was also independent of assimilate supply. In labelled plots delta(13)C(SR) reflected a rapid transfer and respiratory use of freshly plant-assimilated C and a diurnal shift in the predominant respiratory C source from recent (i.e. at least 1 d old) to fresh (i.e. photoassimilates produced on the same day). We conclude that in grasslands the plant-derived substrates used for soil respiratory processes vary during the day, and that photosynthesis provides an important and immediate C source. These findings indicate a tight coupling in the plant-soil system and the importance of plant metabolism for soil CO(2) fluxes.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is essential for sustaining food production and maintaining ecosystem services and is a vital resource base for storing C and N. The impact of long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N on SOM, however, has been questioned recently. Here we tested the hypothesis that long-term application of N results in a decrease in SOM. We used data from 135 studies of 114 long-term experiments located at 100 sites throughout the world over time scales of decades under a range of land-management and climate regimes to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). Published data of a total of 917 and 580 observations for SOC and SON, respectively, from control (unfertilized or zero N) and N-fertilized treatments (synthetic, organic, and combination) were analyzed using the SAS mixed model and by meta-analysis. Results demonstrate declines of 7 to 16% in SOC and 7 to 11% in SON with no N amendments. In soils receiving synthetic fertilizer N, the rate of SOM loss decreased. The time-fertilizer response ratio, which is based on changes in the paired comparisons, showed average increases of 8 and 12% for SOC and SON, respectively, following the application of synthetic fertilizer N. Addition of organic matter (i.e., manure) increased SOM, on average, by 37%. When cropping systems fluctuated between flooding and drying, SOM decreased more than in continuous dryland or flooded systems. Flooded rice L.) soils show net accumulations of SOC and SON. This work shows a general decline in SOM for all long-term sites, with and without synthetic fertilizer N. However, our analysis also demonstrates that in addition to its role in improving crop productivity, synthetic fertilizer N significantly reduces the rate at which SOM is declining in agricultural soils, worldwide.},

Dokuchaev (1846-1903), chernozem stands at the forefront of pedology. In 1883, Dokuchaev introduced the first concept of chernozem: he defined chernozem as a steppe soil with pedogenesis dominated by a dry continental climate and steppe vegetation, with calcareous parent material. Chernozem is a soil well known for its high agronomical potential; therefore the perception of chernozem as something extraordinary valuable goes back far into history. Our review presents the key factors of the pedogenesis of chernozem by explaining the causes of the high stability of its organic matter and the role of vegetation and  fauna in this process. Moreover, it shows that chernozem can have many aspects due to various (a) textures, (b) chemical compositions, (c) influence of water, (d) fauna, or (e) anthropogenic factors. We examine the position of chernozem in numerous national and international soil classifications over time. We have found out that chernozem had been classified, according to its properties, as a "steppe soil", as a "calcic soil" or as an "isohumic soil".},

abstract = {Short-rotation coppice willow (SRCW) is a fast-growing and potentially high-yielding energy crop. Transition to bioenergy has been identified in Sweden as one strategy to mitigate climate change and decrease the current dependency on fossil fuel. In this study, life cycle assessment was used to evaluate and compare the climate impacts of SRCW systems, for the purpose of evaluating key factors influencing the climate change mitigation potential of SRCW grown on agricultural land in Sweden. Seven different scenarios were defined and analysed to identify the factors with the most influence on the climate. A carbon balance model was used to model carbon fluxes between soil, biomass and atmosphere under Swedish growing conditions. The results indicated that SRCW can act as a temporary carbon sink and therefore has a mitigating effect on climate change. The most important factor in obtaining a high climate change-mitigating effect was shown to be high yield. Low yield gave the worst mitigating effect of the seven scenarios, but it was still better than the effect of the reference systems, district heating produced from coal or natural gas.},

abstract = {The most widely applied soil carbon models partition the soil organic carbon into two or more kinetically defined conceptual pools. The initial distribution of soil organic matter between these pools influences the simulations. Like many other soil organic carbon models, the DAYCENT model is initialised by assuming equilibrium at the beginning of the simulation. However, as we show here, the initial distribution of soil organic matter between the different pools has an appreciable influence on simulations, and the appropriate distribution is dependent on the climate and management at the site before the onset of a simulated experiment. If the soil is not in equilibrium, the only way to initialise the model is to simulate the pre-experimental period of the site. Most often, the site history, in terms of land use and land management is often poorly defined at site level, and entirely unknown at regional level. Our objective was to identify a method that can be applied to initialise a model when the soil is not in equilibrium and historic data are not available, and which quantifies the uncertainty associated with initial soil carbon distribution. We demonstrate a method that uses Bayesian calibration by means of the Accept-Reject algorithm, and use this method to calibrate the initial distribution of soil organic carbon pools against observed soil respiration measurements. It was shown that, even in short-term simulations, model initialisation can have a major influence on the simulated results. The Bayesian calibration method quantified and reduced the uncertainties in initial carbon distribution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Schimel2012a,
abstract = {A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on understanding when and how the composition of the microbial community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years). While research has demonstrated these linkages for physiologically and phylogenetically "narrow" processes such as trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive evidence that microbial community composition influences the "broad" processes of decomposition and organic matter (OM) turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial community structure influences C cycling. We consider the phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds, based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of the species-level diversity probably reflects functional redundancy. We then consider under what conditions it is possible for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and argue that while microbial community structure may be important in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus, it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil, physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the C they take up - not only do the fates of the molecules differ, but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding the long-term fate of C in soil - is it sequestered or not?},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon is chemically heterogeneous, and microbial decomposers face a physiological challenge in metabolizing the diverse array of compounds present in soil. Different classes of polymeric compounds may require specialized enzymatic pathways for degradation, each of which requires an investment of microbial resources. Here we tested the resource allocation hypothesis, which posits that decomposition rates should increase once substrate concentrations are sufficient to overcome biochemical investment costs. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that mixing different substrates increases resource acquisition through priming effects involving generalist enzymes. Using a microcosm approach, we varied the soil concentration of seven distinct substrates individually and in mixture. We found that the percent carbon respired from starch, cellulose, chitin, and the mixture was significantly reduced at the lowest substrate concentration. The activities of $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase that target cellulose and chitin, respectively, were also significantly lower at the lowest concentrations of their target substrates. However, we did not observe parallel declines in enzyme activity with starch or the mixture. Some enzymes, such as $\beta$-xylosidase, were consistent with specialist strategies because they showed the highest activity in the presence of their target substrate. Other enzymes were more generalist, with activity observed across multiple substrates. Together, these results suggest that the costs of biochemical machinery limit microbial decomposition of substrates at low concentration. The presence of enzymes with low substrate specificity was not sufficient to overcome this constraint for some substrates. Concentration constraints driven by microbial allocation patterns may be common in mineral soil and could be represented in new biogeochemical models based on microbial physiology.},

@article{Poorter2012,
abstract = {We quantified the biomass allocation patterns to leaves, stems and roots in vegetative plants, and how this is influenced by the growth environment, plant size, evolutionary history and competition. Dose-response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

abstract = {In recent decades, human- Rangifer (reindeer and caribou) interactions have increasingly been studied from a scientific perspective. Many of the studies have examined Norwegian wild reindeer or caribou in North America. It is often questioned whether results from these studies can be applied to reindeer in managed herds, as these animals have been exposed to domestication and are also more used to humans. In order to examine the domesticated reindeer's reactions to various disturbance sources, we reviewed 18 studies of the effects of human activity and infrastructure on 12 populations of domesticated reindeer and compared these to studies on wild reindeer and caribou; based on this, we discuss the effects of domestication and tameness on reindeer responses to anthropogenic disturbance. We also consider the relevance of spatial and temporal scales and data collection methods when evaluating the results of these studies. The reviewed studies showed that domesticated reindeer exhibit avoidance behaviours up to 12 km away from infrastructure and sites of human activity and that the area they avoid may shift between seasons and years. Despite a long domestication process, reindeer within Sami reindeer-herding systems exhibit similar patterns of large-scale avoidance of anthropogenic disturbance as wild Rangifer, although the strength of their response may sometimes differ. This is not surprising since current Sami reindeer husbandry represents an extensive form of pastoralism, and the reindeer are not particularly tame. To obtain a true picture of how reindeer use their ranges, it is of fundamental importance to study the response pattern at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to the reindeer, whether domesticated or wild.

abstract = {In situ measurements with visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIR) provide an efficient way for acquiring soil information of paddy soils in the short time gap between the harvest and following rotation. The aim of this study was to evaluate its feasibility to predict a series of soil properties including organic matter (OM), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and pH of paddy soils in Zhejiang province, China. Firstly, the linear partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed on the in situ spectra and the predictions were compared to those with laboratory-based recorded spectra. Then, the non-linear least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm was carried out aiming to extract more useful information from the in situ spectra and improve predictions. Results show that in terms of OC, OM, TN, AN and pH, (i) the predictions were worse using in situ spectra compared to laboratory-based spectra with PLSR algorithm (ii) the prediction accuracy using LS-SVM (R2>0.75, RPD>1.90) was obviously improved with in situ vis-NIR spectra compared to PLSR algorithm, and comparable or even better than results generated using laboratory-based spectra with PLSR; (iii) in terms of AP and AK, poor predictions were obtained with in situ spectra (R2<0.5, RPD<1.50) either using PLSR or LS-SVM. The results highlight the use of LS-SVM for in situ vis-NIR spectroscopic estimation of soil properties of paddy soils.},

abstract = {In this study, we produced a detailed digital soil map of topsoil texture and soil organic matter (SOM) content for 2.4. million. ha of arable land in Sweden (DSMS). Three spatially exhaustive datasets (a laser-scanned digital elevation model, airborne gamma radiation scanning data and a legacy Quaternary deposit map) were calibrated against topsoil texture and SOM content in around 13,500 soil samples, using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSplines) modelling. We then deployed the MARSplines models to produce raster maps (50. m. ×. 50. m) of clay, sand and SOM content. The modelling procedure was validated by an independent dataset of about 24,000 samples clustered on 544 farms (with a local sample density of one per 3. ha). The error in clay content was &#60;. 8% in 75% of the validation samples, while for sand content and SOM content it was 13% and 2%, respectively. Corresponding values for the farm-average level were 6%, 11% and 2%, respectively. Modelling efficiency values revealed that the clay content map was a considerable improvement over the mean of the reference values at national level, regional level and, in many cases, also farm level. However, SOM content predictions showed little or no improvement over the mean of the reference samples (at any scale), due to poor correlation with the exhaustive predictor variables at all three scales investigated. The DSMS soil geodatabase will continue to be improved and have more layers added, e.g. derived layers calculated from the primary clay, sand and SOM layers by use of pedotransfer functions. Practical use of DSMS is exemplified here in an internet application for deriving prescription files for precision agriculture.},

abstract = {The diets of fallow deer Dama dama (Linnaeus, 1758) were analysed on the basis of the rumen contents of 69 individuals harvested between October and January in two areas of Poland: Ilawa, where animals are fed artificially in winter and Pszczyna, where almost no winter feeding is applied. The composition of the diet was found to be similar in both areas, with graminoids - as the staple food - accounting for 43.1% in Ilawa and 45.9% in Pszczyna. Further similarities between the areas were noted in regard to the other main foods eaten, ie the foliage of broadleaved deciduous trees and Scots pine, as well as forbs. Together, these four categories of food accounted for 73.1% and 73.0% of the diet in Ilawa and Pszczyna, respectively. Browse and bark were eaten in very small amounts, an observation suggesting that the contribution made by fallow deer to overall cervid-induced damage at least in some Polish forests is relatively small. Sample size limitations confined analysis of monthly food composition to the data from Ilawa only. These revealed graminoids as the major food each month, though shares of the diet ranged between 56.4% in November and 30.3% in January. Maximum levels of consumption of broadleaved deciduous foliage (21.9%) and forbs (10.3%) were recorded in October, and afterwards decreased. In turn, the role of pine foliage share increased from October (7.8%) through January (14.5%). The maximum availability of artificial forage occurred in January and its share in the diet was then as high as 21.2%},

abstract = {The benefits of sequestering carbon are many, including improved crop productivity, reductions in greenhouse gases, and financial gains through the sale of carbon credits. Achieving better understanding of the sequestration process has motivated many deterministic models of soil carbon dynamics, but none of these models address uncertainty in a comprehensive manner. Uncertainty arises in many ways---around the model inputs, parameters, and dynamics, and subsequently model predictions. In this paper, these uncertainties are addressed in concert by incorporating a physical--statistical model for carbon dynamics within a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework. This comprehensive approach to accounting for uncertainty in soil carbon modelling has not been attempted previously. This paper demonstrates proof-of-concept based on a one-pool model and identifies requirements for extension to multi-pool carbon modelling. Our model is based on the soil carbon dynamics in Tarlee, South Australia. We specify the model conditionally through its parameters, soil carbon input and decay processes and observations of those processes. We use a particle marginal Metropolis--Hastings approach specified using the LibBi modelling language. We highlight how samples from the posterior distribution can be used to summarise our knowledge about model parameters, to estimate the probabilities of sequestering carbon and to forecast changes in carbon stocks under crop rotations not represented explicitly in the original field trials.

abstract = {There is a need to improve the understanding of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics for forage-based rotations. A key requisite is accurate estimates of the below-ground (BG) C inputs to soil. We used the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) to investigate the effects of C input assumptions on C balances with data from a 52-yr field experiment in northern Sweden. The main objective was to validate an approach for estimating annual crop residue C inputs to soil using the data from a continuous forage-based rotation (A). A rotation with only annual crops and more frequent tillage events (D) was used to obtain a rough estimate of the effect of tillage on SOC dynamics. The methodology used to estimate annual crop residue C inputs to soil gave a good fit to data from four out of the six large plots for rotation A. The approximate effects of more frequent tillage in rotation D increased SOC decomposition rate by about 20%. These results allow us to have more confidence in predicting SOC balances for forage-based crop rotations. Root biomass measurements used for calculating BG C inputs were also reviewed, and we show that they have not changed significantly during the past 150 yr.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss has become a global concern as evidence accumulates that it will negatively affect ecosystem services on which society depends. So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth's biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability.},

abstract = {1. Changes in the balance between soil carbon storage and release can significantly amplify or attenuate global warming. Although a lot of progress has been made in determining potential drivers of carbon release through large-scale decomposition experiments, climate predictions are still hampered by data limitation at a global scale as a result of high effort and measurement costs of comparative litter decomposition studies. 2. We introduce an innovative, cost-effective, well-standardised method to gather data on decomposition rate and litter stabilisation using commercially available tea bags as standardised test kits. By using two tea types with contrasting decomposability, we can construct a decomposition curve using a single measurement in time. The acquired Tea Bag Index (TBI) consists of two parameters describing decomposition rate (k) and litter stabilisation factor (S). 3. The method was tested for its sensitivity and robustness in contrasting ecosystems and biomes, confirming that the TBI is sensitive enough to discriminate between these systems. Within an ecosystem, TBI is responsive to differences in abiotic circumstances such as soil temperature and moisture content. The collected k and S values are in accordance with expectations based on decomposition process literature. They are therefore interpretable within the current knowledge framework. 4. Tea Bag Index is a unique, multifunctional method requiring few resources and minimal prior knowledge. The standardisation and simplicity of the method make it possible to collect comparable, globally distributed data through crowdsourcing. TBI can further provide an excellent decomposition reference and has the potential to increase reliability of soil carbon flux estimates based on extrapolations of decomposition data.},

abstract = {Clay dispersion in soil results in structural instability and management problems. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the easily dispersed colloidal materials differ in their properties from colloidal materials that do not disperse easily. Soil samples from the topsoil of sodic and non-sodic variants of an Alfisol under irrigated pasture (Kyabram, Victoria, Australia), and from the topsoil and subsoil of a sodic Alfisol under cultivation (Two Wells, South Australia) were fractionated into easily dispersed, moderately dispersed, and difficult to disperse clay, and silt, sand, and light fractions. As a proportion of total clay, easily dispersed clay content was greatest in the subsoil, and least in the Kyabram topsoils. In the topsoils, easily dispersed clay had larger particle size and lower cation exchange capacity than difficult to disperse clay, suggesting that high surface area and charge lead to increased inter-particle interactions and lower dispersibility. Easily dispersed clay had lower organic C contents than difficult to disperse clay. Organic matter was examined by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and the spectra were interpreted using major groups of biomolecules as model components. In all soils, organic matter in the easily dispersed clay fraction contained a high proportion of amino acids, suggesting that amino acids or proteins acted as dispersants. Difficult to disperse clay contained a high proportion of aliphatic materials in the topsoils, and carbohydrate in the subsoil, suggesting that these materials acted as water-stable glues. Selectivity for Na (KG) was negatively correlated with organic C content in the clay fractions. In the Kyabram soils, KG was greater in easily dispersed clay than in difficult to disperse clay. In Two Wells soil, clay with high KG appeared to have already moved out of the topsoil, into the subsoil. This work showed that variability in the nature of organic matter and clay particles has an important influence on clay dispersion in sodic and non-sodic soils.},

abstract = {Changes in biogeochemical cycles and the climate system due to human activities are expected to change the quantity and quality of plant litter inputs to soils. How changing quality of fresh organic matter (FOM) might influence the priming effect (PE) on soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization is still under debate. Here we determined the PE induced by two (13)C-labeled FOMs with contrasting nutritional quality (leaf vs. stalk of Zea mays L.). Soils from two different forest types yielded consistent results: soils amended with leaf tissue switched faster from negative PE to positive PE due to greater microbial growth compared to soils amended with stalks. However, after 16 d of incubation, soils amended with stalks had a higher PE than those amended with leaf. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) results suggested that microbial demand for carbon and other nutrients was one of the major determinants of the PE observed. Therefore, consideration of both microbial demands for nutrients and FOM supply simultaneously is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of PE. Our study provided evidence that changes in FOM quality could affect microbial utilization of substrate and PE on SOM mineralization, which may exacerbate global warming problems under future climate change.},

abstract = {Short-rotation forestry with fast-growing hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. × P. tremuloides Michx.) on former arable lands is a novel land-use system in northern Europe that has substantially increased in the region during the last few decades. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of hybrid aspen plantations to sequestrate C and N to above- and below-ground pools from the age of 5 (young) to 15 years (midterm) depending on former land-use type. Data were collected from permanent experimental plots on former croplands (n = 28) and grasslands (n = 23). Based on repeated soil monitoring and destructive model tree sampling, the following C and N pools were estimated: above-ground biomass of trees, soil uppermost layer (A-horizon), coarse roots and subsoil (below A-horizon up to a depth of 75 cm). On average, A-horizon SOC and N tot pools had decreased significantly on former grasslands, while no change was observed on croplands. Unexpectedly, considerable changes had occurred in subsoil, where SOC and N tot pools increased significantly on both former land-use types. Therefore, grasslands' A-horizon C loss was compensated for by increased coarse-root fraction and subsoil gains. About one-third of below-ground C pool was stored in subsoil. In above-ground leafless part of 15-year-old hybrid aspen model trees the weighted average C concentration was 45.8% and the N concentration was 0.309%. From the age of 5–15, hybrid aspen plantations acted as C sinks because total ecosystem C pool increased significantly by 3.17 Mg C ha −1  yr −1 on former croplands and by 2.56 Mg C ha −1  yr −1 on former grasslands. The main C sequestration had taken place in the above-ground pool (for croplands 73.8% and for grasslands 94.9%). To conclude, hybrid aspen plantations already showed during the first 15 years a great potential to sequestrate C and N at the ecosystem level, whereas former SOC-exhausted croplands have a higher ability to sequestrate new C to the below-ground pool than already SOC-rich grasslands. Deeper subsoil should definitely be taken into account in SOC estimations.},

abstract = {Enhanced soil respiration in response to global warming may substantially increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations above the anthropogenic contribution, depending on the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Here, we compared short-term and seasonal responses of soil respiration to a shifting thermal environment and variable substrate availability via laboratory incubations. To analyze the data from incubations, we implemented a novel process-based model of soil respiration in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Our process model combined a Michaelis–Menten-type equation of substrate availability and microbial biomass with an Arrhenius-type nonlinear temperature response function. We tested the competing hypotheses that apparent thermal acclimation of soil respiration can be explained by depletion of labile substrates in warmed soils, or that physiological acclimation reduces respiration rates. We demonstrated that short-term apparent acclimation can be induced by substrate depletion, but that decreasing microbial biomass carbon (MBC) is also important, and lower MBC at warmer temperatures is likely due to decreased carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Observed seasonal acclimation of soil respiration was associated with higher CUE and lower basal respiration for summer- vs. winter-collected soils. Whether the observed short-term decrease in CUE or the seasonal acclimation of CUE with increased temperatures dominates the response to long-term warming will have important consequences for soil organic carbon storage.},

abstract = {Background: Coarse woody debris (CWD) is very important for forest ecosystems, particularly for biodiversity and carbon storage. Its relevance as a possible reservoir and source of nutrients is less clear, especially in central Europe. Methods: Based on a chronosequence of known ages of logs, we analyzed the nutrients stored in CWD of Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris at different sites in Germany. To quantify nutrient concentrations, we assessed the use of Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the chemical properties of CWD. Results: NIRS models were suitable to predict concentrations of C, N, P, lignin and extractives. Concentrations of most nutrients increased with mass loss, with the exception of potassium, which decreased for beech and pine and remained relatively constant for spruce. The highest nutrient concentrations (N, P, S, Ca and Mn, except Mg and K) were generally observed in highly decomposed spruce logs. The net effect of decreasing CWD mass and increasing nutrient concentrations was either a decreasing (N, P and K in beech; P, Mg, K and Mn in pine), constant (S, Ca and Mg in beech; N, S and Ca in pine) or increasing amount of nutrients (N, P, S and Ca in spruce; Mn in beech) in the logs over the course of decomposition. The C/N ratio decreased for all tree species, most markedly for spruce from ca. 1000 at the beginning of the decomposition process to 180 at 36 years. The N/P ratio converged to a value of about 30 for all three species. Lignin concentrations increased for spruce and beech and remained constant for pine. Conclusions: Our results indicate that most nutrients remain in CWD for long periods. Nutrients may be used and cycled by microorganisms within CWD, but with the exception of P (in beech), Mg (in pine) and K (in beech and pine), there appears to be little net nutrient export until two thirds of the mass is lost. Instead, N, P, S and Ca were accumulated in spruce logs, indicating that CWD became a net sink rather than a net source of some nutrients for several decades.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two dominant nutrients regulating the productivity of most terrestrial ecosystems. The growing imbalance of anthropogenic N and P inputs into the future is estimated to exacerbate P limitation on land and limit the land carbon (C) sink, so that we hypothesized that P limitation will increasingly reduce C sequestered per unit N deposited into the future. Using a global land surface model (CABLE), we simulated the effects of increased N deposition with and without P limitation on land C uptake and the fate of deposited N on land from 1901 to 2100. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that N deposition continued to induce land C sequestration into the future, contributing to 15% of future C sequestration as opposed to 6% over the historical period. P limitation reduced the future land C uptake per unit N deposited only moderately at the global scale but P limitation increasingly caused N deposition to have net negative effects on the land C balance in the temperate zone. P limitation further increased the fraction of deposited N that is lost via leaching to aquatic ecosystems, globally from 38.5% over the historical period to 53% into the future, and up to 75% in tropical ecosystems. Our results suggest continued N demand for plant productivity but also indicate growing adverse N deposition effects in the future biosphere, not fully accounted for in global models, emphasizing the urgent need to elaborate on model representations of N and P dynamics.},

abstract = {Land use changes like afforestation and deforestation are known to affect stocks of carbon in soils. We measured changes in soil carbon stocks in afforested and deforested sites. Repeated measurements were made at six sites which had been afforested with three different tree species 17-18. years before this sampling. The deforestation sites consisted of six field soils that were taken to cultivation 1-200. years before the sampling and adjacent forest sites representing the same soil types as the fields. The performance of the Yasso07 model in predicting the soil carbon stock changes in afforestation and deforestation was evaluated by simulating the changes in the carbon stocks and comparing the measured and simulated results for these sites. The mean observed 20-year carbon stock change after the land use change was - 9% in the afforested sites and - 19% in the deforested sites. The decrease in the mean carbon stock after afforestation was most pronounced during the first 9-10. years and was probably due to low rates of litter production in the early growth phase of the forests. The stock change in deforestation was lowest in fields with grasses as the main crop and highest in cereal monoculture. The simulation results were well in accordance with the measured carbon stocks on most sites. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bioenergy has been under intense scrutiny over the last ten years with significant research efforts in many countries taking place to define and measure sustainable practices. We describe here the main challenges and policy issues and provide policy recommendations for scaling up sustainable bioenergy approaches globally. The 2016 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs defined under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP21) will not reach global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission targets of 2 °C. Sustainable biomass production can make a significant contribution. Substantive evidence exists that many bioenergy cropping systems can bring multiple benefits and off-set environmental problems associated with fossil fuels usage as well as intensive food production and urbanization. We provide evidence that there are many approaches to land use for bioenergy expansion that do not lead to competition for food or other needs. We should focus on how to manage these approaches on a synergistic basis and how to reduce tradeoffs at landscape scales. Priorities include successful synergies between bioenergy and food security (integrated resource management designed to improve both food security and access to bioenergy), investments in technology, rural extension, and innovations that build capacity and infrastructure, promotion of stable prices to incentivize local production and use of double cropping and flex crops (plants grown for both food and non-food markets) that provide food and energy as well as other services. The sustainable production of biomass requires appropriate policies to secure long-term support to improve crop productivity and also to ensure environmental as well as economic and social benefits of bioenergy cropping systems. Continuous support for cropping, infrastructure, agricultural management and related policies is needed to foster positive synergies between food crops and bioenergy production. In comparison to fossil fuels, biofuels have many positive environmental benefits. Potential negative effects caused by land-use change and agriculture intensification can be mitigated by agroecological zoning, best management practices, the use of eco-hydrology and biodiversity-friendly concepts at field, watershed and landscape scales. Global climate and environmental changes related to the use of fossil fuels and inequitable development make it unethical not to pursue more equitable energy development that includes bioenergy. To achieve sustainable development, competitiveness and costs of bioenergy production need to be addressed in a manner that considers not only economic gains but also development of local knowledge and social and environmental benefits.},

abstract = {Characterizing the use of carbon (C) reserves in trees is important for understanding regional and global C cycles, stress responses, asynchrony between photosynthetic activity and growth demand, and isotopic exchanges in studies of tree physiology and ecosystem C cycling. Using an inadvertent, whole-ecosystem radiocarbon ((14)C) release in a temperate deciduous oak forest and numerical modeling, we estimated that the mean age of stored C used to grow both leaf buds and new roots is 0.7 years and about 55% of new-root growth annually comes from stored C. Therefore, the calculated mean age of C used to grow new-root tissue is similar to 0.4 years. In short, new roots contain a lot of stored C but it is young in age. Additionally, the type of structure used to model stored C input is important. Model structures that did not include storage, or that assumed stored and new C mixed well (within root or shoot tissues) before being used for root growth, did not fit the data nearly as well as when a distinct storage pool was used. Consistent with these whole-ecosystem labeling results, the mean age of C in new-root tissues determined using `bomb-(14)C' in three additional forest sites in North America and Europe (one deciduous, two coniferous) was less than 1-2 years. The effect of stored reserves on estimated ages of fine roots is unlikely to be large in most natural abundance isotope studies. However, models of root C dynamics should take stored reserves into account, particularly for pulse-labeling studies and fast-cycling roots (< 1 years).},

abstract = {Abstract Limiting the impact of wildlife damage in a cost effective manner requires an understanding of how control inputs change the occurrence of damage through their effect on animal den- sity. Despite this, there are few studies linking wildlife management (control), with changes in animal abundance and prevailing levels of wildlife damage.We use the impact and man- agement of wild pigs as a case study to demonstrate this linkage. Ground disturbance by wild pigs has become a conservation issue of global concern because of its potential effects on successional changes in vegetation structure and composition, habitat for other species, and functional soil properties. In this study, we used a 3-year pig control programme (ground hunting) undertaken in a temperate rainforest area of northern New Zealand to evaluate effects on pig abundance, and patterns and rates of ground disturbance and ground disturbance recovery and the cost effectiveness of differing control strategies. Con- trol reduced pig densities by over a third of the estimated carrying capacity, but more than halved average prevailing ground disturbance. Rates of new ground disturbance acceler- ated with increasing pig density, while rates of ground disturbance recovery were not related to prevailing pig density. Stochastic simulation models based on the measured relationships between control, pig density and rate of ground disturbance and recovery indicated that control could reduce ground disturbance substantially. However, the rate at which prevailing ground disturbance was reduced diminished rapidly as more intense, and hence expensive, pig control regimes were simulated. The model produced in this study provides a framework that links conservation of indigenous ecological communities to control inputs through the reduction of wildlife damage and suggests that managers should consider carefully the mar- ginal cost of higher investment in wildlife damage control, relative to its marginal conserva- tion return.},

abstract = {The physical structure of litter can be introduced into decomposition models in several ways. We have used the continuous-quality theory to analyse three models: (i) initial quality of litter or growth rate of decomposers depends on the physical structure of litter, (ii) decomposer colonization rate of litter depends on litter shape and size, and (iii) a constant decomposition rate, i.e., no effect of litter shape and size. Our analysis shows that it is important to separate the physical factors affecting access to carbon (C), i.e., decomposer colonization rate, from the chemical characteristics of litter in decomposition models. Soil C stores predicted with models based on the colonization rate of decomposers are much less sensitive to the shape and size of coarse woody litter than predictions based on the two other approaches. The effect of temperature on steady-state soil C storage is greater for litter that is colonized rapidly than for litter that is colonized slowly. The decomposition of litter types like needles, fine roots, and field-layer vegetation is therefore more sensitive to temperature changes than the decomposition of stems and coarse roots, and this difference is more pronounced at high temperatures than at low temperatures.},

abstract = {This study was designed as a log-scale examination of the influence that decomposing coarse woody debris (CWD in situ for 15 y following harvesting) had on soil carbon and nutrient levels. The study included 4 study sites representing 2 soil types: loamy tills versus sandy outwashes. The mature, fire-origin mixed conifer stands occupying these sites were clearcut harvested in 1994. In 2009, estimates of both total soil carbon and total and available nutrient pools were compared in locations under versus away from CWD. The presence of decaying CWD (now decay classes 3-4) significantly increased soil carbon (+85 %) and nitrogen (+49 %) pools. Estimates of inorganic N from a fresh soil 2M KCL extraction, however, were lower underneath the logs, suggesting that N immobilization is occurring as part of the decomposition process. In contrast, the presence of CWD had no significant effect on P, K, Ca, or Mg soil pools. Although there were marked differences in soil nutrient pools between the 2 soil types, the patterns associated with the presence of CWD were largely the same, and suggest that the influence of CWD does not extend beyond the bounds of the CWD. The results suggest that it will be important that biomass harvesting guidelines consider and include CWD retention levels to ensure that this important ecosystem component, with its associated functions (e.g., soil fertility, nutrient cycling), is maintained in harvested landscapes.},

abstract = {Because of their controlled nature, the presence of independent replicates, and their known management history long-term field experiments are key to the understanding of factors controlling soil carbon. Together with isotope measurements, they provide profound insight into soil carbon dynamics. For soil radiocarbon, an important tracer for understanding these dynamics, in-field variability across replicates is usually not accounted for, hence, a relevant source of uncertainty for quantifying turnover rates is missing. Here, for the first time, radiocarbon measurements of independent field replicates, and for different layers, of soil from the 60 years old controlled field experiment ZOFE in Zurich, Switzerland, is used to address this issue. 14C variability was the same across three different treatments and for three different soil layers between surface and 90 cm depths. On average, in-field variability in 14C content was 12 times the analytical error but still, on a relative basis, smaller than that of in-field soil carbon concentration variability. Despite a relative homogeneous variability across the field and along the soil profile, the curved nature of the relationship between radiocarbon content and modelled carbon mean residence time suggests that the absolute error, without consideration of in-field variability, introduced to soil carbon turnover time calculations increases with soil depth. In our field experiment findings on topsoil carbon turnover variability would, if applied to subsoil, tend to underweight turnover variability even if in-field variability of the subsoil isotope concentration is not higher. Together, in-field variability in radiocarbon is an important component in an overall uncertainty assessment of soil carbon turnover.},

abstract = {Stumps are a source of renewable energy (bioenergy) that can mitigate climate change. We aimed to determine whether conclusions from recent studies could be generalized for other sites by monitoring the in situ soil respiration (Rs) by a portable soil-respiration system of 14 clear-cut experimental sites during the first 2 years after stump extraction and site preparation. The sites were established all over Sweden in 2013 and 2014 and were subjected to no disturbance (Control), patch scarification (PatchS), disc trenching (DiscT), and stump harvesting (StumpH). During year 1, Rs from sites treated with PatchS and StumpH were 11% and 13% lower than Rs from Control sites. DiscT-treated sites were apt to produce lower Rs than the Control (−9%, p =.09). In the second year, there were no significant differences in Rs between treatments, as no soil disturbance type occurring after stump harvest and site preparation had higher Rs than untreated, intact soil. Our results suggest that soil disturbances resulting from stump harvest and site preparation do not generally increase Rs and thus, from this perspective, provide support for the use of stumps for bioenergy.},

abstract = {Root turnover is a critical component of ecosystem nutrient dynamics and carbon sequestration and is also an important sink for plant primary productivity. We tested global controls on root turnover across climatic gradients and for plant functional groups by using a database of 190 published studies. Root turnover rates increased exponentially with mean annual temperature for fine roots of grasslands (r2 = 0.48) and forests (r2 = 0.17) and for total root biomass in shrublands (r2 = 0.55). On the basis of the best-fit exponential model, the Q10 for root turnover was 1.4 for forest small diameter roots (5 mm or less), 1.6 for grassland fine roots, and 1.9 for shrublands. Surprisingly, after accounting for temperature, there was no such global relationship between precipitation and root turnover. The slowest average turnover rates were observed for entire tree root systems (10% annually), followed by 34% for shrubland total roots, 53% for grassland fine roots, 55% for wetland fine roots, and 56% for forest fine roots. Root turnover decreased from tropical to high-latitude systems for all plant functional groups. To test whether global relationships can be used to predict interannual variability in root turnover, we evaluated 14 yr of published root turnover data from a shortgrass steppe site in northeastern Colorado, USA. At this site there was no correlation between interannual variability in mean annual temperature and root turnover. Rather, turnover was positively correlated with the ratio of growing season precipitation and maximum monthly temperature (r2 = 0.61). We conclude that there are global patterns in rates of root turnover between plant groups and across climatic gradients but that these patterns cannot always be used for the successful prediction of the relationship of root turnover to climate change at a particular site.},

abstract = {Soils are self-organized ecological systems within which organisms
interact within a nested suite of discrete scales. Microorganisms form
communities and physical structures at the smallest scale (microns),
followed by the community of their predators organized in microfoodwebs
(tens of microns), the functional domains built by ecosystem engineers
(centimeters to meters), ecosystems, and landscapes. Ecosystem
engineers, principally plant roots, earthworms, termites, and ants, play
key roles in creating habitats for other organisms and controlling their
activities through physical and biochemical processes. The biogenic,
organic, and organomineral structures that they produce accumulate in
the soil space to form three-dimensional mosaics of functional domains,
inhabited by specific communities of smaller organisms (microfauna and
mesofauna, microorganisms) that drive soil processes through specific
pathways. Ecosystem engineers also produce signaling and energy-rich
molecules that act as ecological mediators of biological engineering
processes. Energy-rich ecological mediators may selectively activate
microbial populations and trigger priming effects, resulting in the
degradation, synthesis, and sequestration of specific organic
substrates. Signaling molecules inform soil organisms of their
producers' respective presences and change physiologies by modifying
gene expression and through eliciting hormonal responses. Protection of
plants against pests and diseases is largely achieved via these
processes. At the highest scales, the delivery of ecosystem services
emerges through the functioning of self-organized systems nested within
each other. The integrity of the different subsystems at each scale and
the quality of their interconnections are a precondition for an optimum
and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. Lastly, we present seven
general research questions whose resolution will provide a firmer base
for the proposed conceptual framework while offering new insights for
sustainable use of the soil resource.},

This study focuses on the potential ecological value of such trees. The study was conducted in six reserves in Sweden that were hit by a storm in 1995 and suffered from tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.) (Col.; Curculionidae). The volumes of storm-felled trees and of standing trees killed by the spruce bark beetle were recorded during 5 years after the storm. In the present study five of the six reserves were revisited in 2006. Of the dead standing wood, 81% was created by the spruce bark beetle, while 19% constituted of stumps from trees broken by the storm. Thirty-seven per cent of the beetle-killed trees remained standing in 2006, 8-9 years after tree death. A significantly higher frequency of fruiting bodies of Fomitopsis pinicola on broken snags compared with on intact snags indicates that the rot caused by this fungus contributed to tree fall. Almost 30% of the bark remained on both intact and fallen snags. The ecological value of snags created by the spruce bark beetle is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Multi-compartment soil carbon (C) simulation models such as RothC are widely used for predicting changes in C stocks of arable soils. However, rigorous routines for establishing entry pools that account for the diversity of exogenous organic matter (EOM) applied to croplands are still lacking. We obtained data on changes in soil C stocks after repeated applications of EOM from four long-term experiments (LTEs): Askov K2 (Denmark, 31 yrs), Qualiagro (France, 11 yrs), SERAIL (France, 14 yrs) and Ultuna (Sweden, 52 yrs). The adjustment of the partition coefficients of total organic C in EOM (EOM-TOC) into the labile, resistant and humified entry pools of RothC (f DPM, f RPM, f HUM, respectively) provided a successful fit to the accumulation of EOM-derived C in the LTE soils. Equations estimating the EOM partition coefficients in the RothC model were based on an indicator (I ROC) of the EOM-TOC potentially retained in soil. I ROC was derived from the C found in the soluble, lignin + cutin-like and cellulose-like Van Soest fractions and the proportion of EOM-TOC mineralized during 3 days of incubation. Using the EOM partition coefficients derived from these laboratory analyses resulted in RothC simulations with only slightly larger errors than simulations based on partition coefficients fitted from LTE soil data, except for EOMs that caused very large accumulations of C in soil (e.g. peat) possibly due to factors not accounted for in the RothC model, such as change in soil pH. The proposed partitioning of EOM-TOC allows the potential soil C storage after EOM applications to be predicted regardless of field location and specific composition of EOMs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have analyzed the carbon sequestration potential of forests and forest management. However, most studies either focused on national and supra-national scales or on the project level in the context of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. Few studies are available which analyze the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies on carbon sequestration, timber production and other forest services and functions at the operational level of the forest management unit (FMU). The present study investigates effects of three alternative management strategies for secondary Norway spruce forests (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (Norway spruce age class forestry; continuous cover forestry; conversion to mixed broadleaved forests) and an unmanaged control variant on C sequestration in situ, in wood products and through bioenergy production at the level of a private FMU in Austria, and analyses the interrelationships with timber production and key indicators of biodiversity. The hybrid patch model PICUS v1.4 and a wood products model are employed to simulate forest ecosystem development, timber production, carbon storage in the forest and in wood product pools. Results show that in situ C sequestration is sensitive to forest management with the highest amount of carbon stored in the unmanaged strategy, followed by the continuous cover regime. All three management strategies store substantial quantities of C in the wood products pool. Considering alternative biomass utilization focused on bioenergy production, substantial C offsets could be generated from potential substitution of fossil fuels. Opportunity cost estimates for C sequestration reveal that C sequestration through forest management can be a cost efficient way to reduce atmospheric CO2, but the achievable quantities are limited due to biological limitations and societal constraints. The study emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable forest management strategies that serve the multiple demands on forests in the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Soil organic matter models with complex ecological mechanisms usually include a large number of parameters than simpler models that omit detailed processes. Finding parameter values for these complex models is challenging given the poor availability of comprehensive datasets that describe different processes. Depending on the type of data available, the estimation of parameters in complex models may lead to identifiability problems, i.e. obtaining different combinations of parameters that give equally good predictions in comparison with the observed data. In this manuscript, we explore the problem of identifiability in soil organic matter models, pointing out combinations of empirical data and model structure that can minimize identifiability issues. We found that only sets of up to 3 or 4 parameters may be uniquely identifiable, depending on the number of data constrains used for parameter identification. When only using data on soil respiration fluxes from soil incubations or mass loss from litter decay studies, up to 2 parameters can be uniquely identifiable independently on the model structure. For nonlinear microbial models, all parameters cannot be identified simultaneously with mass loss or respiration data, combined with additional constraints from isotopes. Parameter identifiability possess series challenges for proposing complex model structures in global soil carbon models given the limitation of comprehensive datasets at a global scale.},

The major current challenge is to validate mechanistic descriptions of microbial processes and predicted system responses against experimental observations. We analyzed soil biochemical models of different complexity regarding parameter identifiability using information geometry, i.e. a model is geometrically interpreted as a manifold embedded in data space. The most complex model (PECCAD) was used as a test case to reveal parsimonious process formulations. All models showed sloppiness, i.e. most individual parameter values cannot be inferred from the observed data. We derived a less complex model formulation of PECCAD with effective inferable parameter combinations and identified structural model limitations. The complexity of identified effective models was systematically reduced with decreasing information content of data. Our results suggest that information geometry provides a powerful approach to derive effective descriptions of relevant biogeochemical processes and reduce structural model uncertainty.},
