title: "Me."
---

I am a researcher in ecology, specifically I do ecosystem modeling.
More specifically, I model organic matter decomposition. I am fascinated by organic matter even before soil, as well as decomposition itself. It is for me a hymn to entropy, which means just life. And death.
I am born in Tuscany, but I live and work in Sweden.
